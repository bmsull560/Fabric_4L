### Layer 5 Compatibility Policy (Required for contract-impacting Layer 5 changes)

Reference: `docs/reference/layer5-api-compatibility-policy.md`

- **Compatibility classification:** Additive-safe | Breaking
- **Consumer impact assessment:** (frontend, generated clients, Layer 4, Layer 6, external consumers)
- **Rollback behavior if downstream parsers fail:**
- [ ] Completed required frontend/generated-client update steps per policy.
- [ ] Completed required Layer 4 / Layer 6 integration test updates per policy.

### Phase 3 API Evolution Linked Updates (Required When L5 API Surface Changes)

- [ ] Updated `contracts/openapi/layer5-ground-truth.json`.
- [ ] Regenerated and committed generated client outputs for impacted surfaces.
- [ ] Updated consumer integration tests for impacted Layer 4 / Layer 6 paths.

## Release & Policy Checklist (Required)

- [ ] If API behavior/contracts changed, I updated `contracts/openapi/` and/or `contracts/jsonschema/`.
- [ ] If API changes are breaking, I created/updated a major version and included migration guidance.
- [ ] If deprecating APIs, I documented deprecation start and sunset dates per `docs/api-versioning-policy.md`.
- [ ] I reviewed DR expectations in `docs/reliability/dr-policy.md` and updated recovery docs if service criticality changed.
- [ ] For resilience-impacting changes, I updated or validated DR runbooks in `docs/runbooks/`.
- [ ] If this PR claims Layer 5 Phase 0 closure/readiness, all discovered Layer 5 issues include owner and due date (per `docs/governance/layer5-backlog-issue-template.md`); otherwise Phase 0 remains open.

## Validation

- [ ] `make verify`
- [ ] `make evals` (required for agent/skill prompt changes)
