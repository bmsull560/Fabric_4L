"""Connection pool exhaustion tests for database reliability invariant.

Validates that:
1. Connection pool handles exhaustion gracefully
2. max_overflow provides buffer when pool is exhausted
3. Pool pre-ping prevents stale connections
4. System recovers after pool exhaustion
5. Concurrent requests are queued or rejected appropriately
