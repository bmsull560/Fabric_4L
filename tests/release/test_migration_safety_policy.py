"""Release-policy checks for destructive database migrations.

These tests intentionally inspect migration source because destructive schema
changes can pass application-level tests while still being unsafe to run against
production-like data. Any migration that drops tables, columns, or constraints
must document operator intent and include a fail-closed runtime guard.
