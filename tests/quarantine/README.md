# Test Quarantine

**Purpose:** Isolated location for tests that are temporarily failing due to external dependencies, not code defects.

## Quarantined Tests

### 1. `test_docker_integration.py`
- **Reason:** Docker-dependent failures
- **Issue:** Requires Docker-in-Docker for CI
- **Tracking:** Issue #124
- **Owner:** QA team
- **Expected Resolution:** 2026-05-01

## Running Quarantined Tests

```bash
# Run quarantined tests separately (allowed to fail)
pytest tests/quarantine/ -v --ignore-glob="*README*" || true
```

## Policy

- Tests in quarantine are NOT blocking PRs
- Tests must be fixed and returned to main test suite within 30 days
- Each quarantined test MUST have a tracking issue
- Weekly review of quarantined tests required
