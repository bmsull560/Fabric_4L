"""Architecture contract for Layer 3 API models module.

The value_fabric.layer3 namespace is a path-redirect shim: its __init__.py
appends services/layer3-knowledge/src/ to __path__, making the service tree
the canonical source.  services/layer3-knowledge/src/api/models.py is therefore
the canonical Pydantic models module — it must define model classes and must
not be an empty re-export wrapper.
