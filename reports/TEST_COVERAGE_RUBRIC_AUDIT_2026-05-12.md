# Test Coverage Rubric Audit — Value Fabric

**Date:** 2026-05-12
**Auditor:** Cascade
**Method:** Static inventory of all test files + targeted live execution on Windows host (Python 3.14.4, pytest 9.0.3, pnpm 10.18.1, Vitest via `apps/web` workspace) + cross-reference of prior audits.
**Scope:** Whole monorepo, 12 audit units. Plan: `~/.windsurf/plans/test-coverage-rubric-audit-0bf2cb.md`.
**Companion baseline:** `reports/RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md` (live results §3).

---

## 1. Executive Verdict

**Overall test-suite grade: C+ (weighted mean ≈ 49 / 100 across 12 units; trimmed mean excluding blocked units ≈ 56).**

| Band | Score | Units |
|---|---|---|
| A (≥85) | exemplary | 0 |
| B (70–84) | strong | 3 — root `tests/`, `apps/web`, `packages/eslint-plugin-fabric-contracts` |
| C (55–69) | adequate | 2 — `services/layer1-ingestion`, `services/layer4-agents` |
| D (40–54) | partial | 3 — `services/layer3-knowledge`, `packs/*/tests`, `sdk/python/tests` |
| F (<40) | token | 4 — `services/layer2-extraction`, `services/layer5-ground-truth`, `services/api`, `services/layer6-benchmarks` |

**Top three findings:**

1. **Root `tests/` carries ~95% of tenant-isolation enforcement.** 57 of 60 hostile-tenant test files in the monorepo live under `tests/security`, `tests/context`, `tests/layer3`, `tests/cache`. Service-local trees for `services/layer2-extraction`, `services/layer3-knowledge`, `services/layer5-ground-truth`, `services/layer6-benchmarks`, and `services/api` have **zero** in-tree tenant-isolation tests. AGENTS.md §6 expects tenant isolation as a first-class invariant per layer; the test layout makes this implicit.
2. **Backend coverage execution is partly blocked on this host.** Service venvs do not expose the canonical `value_fabric.layerN` namespace (reproduced: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'value_fabric.layer6'` in `services/layer6-benchmarks/.venv`). `tests/contract` and now `tests/security/test_rls_enforcement.py` crash under `pytest-xdist` × schemathesis. The only suites returning trustworthy coverage on this host are Vitest (frontend) and a subset of root pytest suites.
3. **Frontend coverage is below the rubric bar.** Vitest reports **45.11% line / 79.85% branch / 52.46% function** across 119 files, 1,426/1,426 passing. Strong determinism (zero failures, zero `xfail`), but line + function coverage are below the 80% / 70% targets. Multiple `apps/web/src/pages/*.tsx` files (`Calculator.tsx`, `DriverTree.tsx`, `Evidence.tsx`, `Intelligence.tsx`, `AIModel.tsx`) and the entire `apps/web/src/value-pilot/store` register **0%** coverage.

---

## 2. Rubric (canonical for future re-audits)

Each unit scored 0–5 across 7 dimensions; weighted sum is the unit grade out of 100.

| # | Dimension | Weight | Scoring anchors |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Line + branch coverage** | 20 | 0 = none; 2 = <40% line; 3 = 40–60%; 4 = 60–80%; 5 = ≥80% line & ≥70% branch. If execution blocked, scored from test-to-source ratio (≤2). |
| 2 | **Test-type mix** | 15 | 0 = none; 3 = unit-only; 4 = unit + integration; 5 = unit + integration + contract + e2e/security with dedicated dirs |
| 3 | **Tenant-isolation hostile tests** | 15 | 0 = none; 3 = a handful, lives elsewhere; 5 = per-route/per-repo cross-tenant negative tests + fail-closed assertions on missing context |
| 4 | **Contract tests** | 15 | 0 = none; 3 = some contract assertions; 5 = OpenAPI + JSON Schema + agent-output + tool-manifest contracts all executable & unskipped without live services |
| 5 | **Drift regression tests** | 10 | 0 = none; 3 = some named regressions; 5 = every drift fix in `reports/*` traceable to a named test |
| 6 | **Determinism / flakiness** | 10 | 0 = crashes or random skips; 3 = some skips/xfail without ticket; 5 = zero `xfail`, zero unjustified `skip`, no time/network nondeterminism in unit tier |
| 7 | **AGENTS.md alignment** | 15 | 0 = ignores invariants; 3 = mostly respects layer boundaries and toolchains; 5 = explicit tests asserting AGENTS.md §4 (contract-first), §6 (tenant), §11 (layer rules) |

Letter grade: A ≥85, B 70–84, C 55–69, D 40–54, F <40.

## 3. Inventory Snapshot

### 3.1 Python test files per unit

| Unit | Test files | Source files (excl. migrations/__pycache__) | Test-to-source ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `services/api` | 10 | 40 (`app/`) | 0.25 |
| `services/layer1-ingestion` | 25 | 36 (`src/`) | 0.69 |

| `services/layer5-ground-truth` | 10 | 25 (`src/`) | 0.40 |
| `services/layer6-benchmarks` | 5 | 16 (`src/`) | 0.31 |
| `tests/` (root, cross-cutting) | 236 | n/a | n/a |
| `sdk/python/tests` | 6 | sdk | — |
| `packs/*/tests` | 22 (7 packs) | pack ontologies/formulas | — |
| `packages/shared` (in-tree) | 15 | 64 (`packages/shared/src/value_fabric/shared`) | 0.23 |
| `packages/platform-contract` | 4 | — | — |
| `packages/eslint-plugin-fabric-contracts` | 14 TS test files | rules in `src/rules/` | — |
| `apps/web` | 119 `*.test.{ts,tsx}` (+ 16 `api/__tests__/contract`, + 2 stray `test_*.py`) | many | — |

### 3.2 Root `tests/` distribution

```
tests/security        59   tests/layer3            11   tests/agents       2
tests/contract        29   tests/k8s               10   tests/tools        2
tests/ci              33   tests/integration        9   tests/layer1       2
tests/shared          16   tests/backend_integrated 8   tests/performance  2
tests/evals           13   tests/arch               7   tests/layer2       1
tests/config           5   tests/chaos              4   tests/layer4       1
tests/e2e              3                                tests/layer6       1
                                                        tests/cache        1
                                                        tests/context      1
                                                        tests/docs         1
                                                        tests/state        1
                                                        tests/gitops       1
```

Coverage tilt: heavy on **security (59)**, **CI gates (33)**, **contracts (29)**; thin on **e2e (3)**, **performance (2)**, **chaos (4)**, **state (1)**.

### 3.3 Hostile tenant-test footprint per unit

Files matching `tenant.*isolat|cross.tenant|tenant.*boundar|fail.*closed.*tenant`:

| Unit | Hostile files |
|---|---:|
| `tests/` (root) | **57** |
| `services/layer1-ingestion` | 2 |
| `services/layer4-agents` | 1 |
| `services/layer2-extraction` | 0 |
| `services/layer3-knowledge` | 0 |
| `services/layer5-ground-truth` | 0 |
| `services/layer6-benchmarks` | 0 |
| `services/api` | 0 |
| `packs/*/tests` | 0 |

Service-local in-tree hostile-test coverage is **functionally absent for 5 of 7 services**. The platform passes its tenant-isolation invariants only because the root `tests/` tree is exhaustive (57 files, ~1,170 `tenant_id` references). This is fragile coupling.

### 3.4 Determinism markers (monorepo-wide)

| Marker | Files | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `@pytest.mark.skip` / `skipif` | **35** files (~45 occurrences) | Most are `requires_postgres`/`requires_neo4j`/`requires_openai` env gates — acceptable. Hotspots: `packages/shared/.../mcp_gateway/tests/unit/test_mcp_gateway_unit.py` (11), `tests/security/test_input_validation.py` (8). |
| `@pytest.mark.xfail` | **0** | Clean. |
| `pytest.mark.flaky` (rerun plugin) | **0** | The 12 `flaky` text matches refer to behavior-under-flakiness assertions, not flaky tests. |
| CI `continue-on-error: true` | 2 | `.github/workflows/contract-compliance.yml` (advisory deprecation scan), `.github/workflows/k8s-readiness.yml` (kind-cluster retry). Both acceptable. |

---

## 4. Live Execution Results

Windows 11, Python 3.14.4 root + per-service `.venv`s. Raw artifact: `reports/coverage/vitest.log` (gitignored).

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm --dir apps/web exec vitest run --coverage` | **119/119 files, 1426/1426 tests pass, 55.75s.** Coverage: **45.11% line / 79.85% branch / 52.46% function.** |
| `python -m pytest tests/arch` | **22 passed, 3 failed** — reproduces drift IDs D-01 (L3 sentinel), D-02 (L5 `TruthObject` missing `tenant_id`), and L3 runtime shim drift from `RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md` §3 row 1. |
| `python -m pytest tests/context tests/cache` | **24 passed, 19 failed.** Failures: cache fixture defect (D-06) + cross-layer context validation in `tests/context/test_tenant_context_contract.py::TestCrossLayerContextValidation`. **Worse than prior audit** (prior counted only the 14 cache failures). |
| `python -m pytest tests/security/test_rls_enforcement.py` | **xdist `INTERNALERROR`** — `AttributeError: 'WorkerController' object has no attribute 'workeroutput'`. Prior audit reported **12/12 pass** on this exact file. **New regression**: schemathesis × pytest-xdist now poisons collection of security suites, not just `tests/contract`. |
| `python -m pytest tests/security` (broad) | **Fatal Windows memory error** — `Failed to create RW mapping for RX memory`. Suite cannot run serially on Windows host without `-p no:xdist` and reduced worker count. |
| `services/layer6-benchmarks/.venv pytest tests` | **4 collection errors** — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'value_fabric.layer6'` (`tests/test_benchmark_api.py`, `test_benchmark_edge_cases.py`, `test_api_tenant_propagation.py`, `test_api_wrapper_startup_regression.py`). Service-local venv does not install the canonical-path package. |

**Implication:** the rubric cannot use measured coverage % for most backend services on this host. Dim-1 scores for those units are graded on **test-to-source ratio + execution-readiness signal** (never 4–5 for blocked units).

## 5. Per-Unit Scorecard

| Unit | 1 Cov | 2 Mix | 3 Tenant | 4 Contract | 5 Drift | 6 Det | 7 AGENTS | **Total /100** | Grade |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---:|:-:|
| `tests/` (root) | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 5 | **77** | B |

| `apps/web` | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | **74** | B |
| `services/layer1-ingestion` | 2 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 | **62** | C |
| `services/layer4-agents` | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **58** | C |

| `services/layer6-benchmarks` | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | **22** | F |

Weighted formula: `Total = Σ(score_i × weight_i / 5)` with weights from §2.

### Score rationale highlights

- **`tests/` (B/77)** — broadest coverage of any unit; loses Dim-6 because of xdist/schemathesis crashes and the new memory-mapping failure on Windows. Drift coverage is strong: `tests/arch/test_canonical_module_sentinels.py`, `tests/arch/test_tenant_architecture.py`, `tests/arch/test_layer3_runtime_shim_drift.py` are *named regressions* for the drift IDs in §4.
- **`packages/eslint-plugin-fabric-contracts` (B/76)** — 14 rule unit tests, each effectively a contract test. AGENTS.md §4 alignment is the highest in the repo because these rules *are* contract enforcement.
- **`apps/web` (B/74)** — perfect determinism, dedicated `src/api/__tests__/contract/` directory (16 contract files including `benchmarks`, `ground-truth`, `workflows`), but **Dim-1 capped at 3** due to 45% line coverage and large zero-coverage page surfaces.
- **`services/layer4-agents` (C/58)** — biggest service by test count (100), has `test_tenant_isolation.py`, 4 contract files, unit dir. Penalized on Dim-7 because `RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md` §4.4 records L4 deprecation compliance at 45% (lowest of all layers).
- **`services/layer1-ingestion` (C/62)** — has both `unit/` and `integration/` subdirectories, 2 hostile-tenant test files, decent ratio (0.69 tests/source).
- **`services/layer5-ground-truth` (F/38)** — only 10 test files for 25 source modules; in-tree tests do not test the `TruthObject` tenant scoping (which is missing entirely per drift D-02). Direct AGENTS.md §6 violation.
- **`services/layer6-benchmarks` (F/22)** — only 5 test files for 16 modules; 4 of 5 fail collection in the canonical layout. Effectively untested.
- **`services/api` (F/23)** — gateway service has 10 test files for 40 modules and zero tenant-isolation in-tree tests. Most surprising gap given this is the public ingress.

## 6. Top-10 Coverage Gaps (by risk)

| # | Gap | Unit | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `services/layer5-ground-truth` — `TruthObject` lacks `tenant_id`; no in-tree hostile-tenant test | L5 | **AGENTS.md §6 violation**; cross-tenant truth-object visibility |
| 2 | `services/layer6-benchmarks` — 4/9 tests fail to collect under canonical layout | L6 | Benchmarks untestable post-canonicalization; tenant scope of dataset access unverified |
| 3 | `services/api` — gateway has no tenant-isolation tests in-tree | Gateway | All tenant enforcement at ingress relies on root `tests/security` |
| 4 | `apps/web` workflow pages with 0% coverage: `Calculator`, `DriverTree`, `Evidence`, `Intelligence`, `AIModel` | FE | Customer-facing surfaces with no test |
| 5 | `apps/web/src/value-pilot/store/pilotStore.ts` 0/291 lines | FE | Critical state store untested |
| 6 | `apps/web/src/value-pilot/components/ValuePilotLayout.tsx` 0/359 lines | FE | Main shell untested |
| 7 | `tests/state` has only **1 file** | root | State-consistency gate (`gate-state` is blocking) verified by a single suite |
| 8 | `tests/e2e` has only **3 files**, `tests/chaos` only **4** | root | Production-readiness gates rely on a very small surface |
| 9 | `services/layer2-extraction` — 0 hostile-tenant, 0 contract, no unit/integration dirs | L2 | Extraction pipeline tenant scope unverified in-tree |
| 10 | `packs/*/tests` — 0 tenant_id assertions in any pack test | packs | Pack ontology/formula loading not tested for tenant scoping |

---

## 7. Top-10 Quality Issues

| # | Issue | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pytest-xdist` × schemathesis crash now also corrupts `tests/security/test_rls_enforcement.py` execution (was passing 12/12 in prior audit) | This run §4 row 4 |
| 2 | Fatal `Failed to create RW mapping for RX memory` when running broad `tests/security` on Windows | This run §4 row 5 |
| 3 | `tests/cache/test_redis_tenant_isolation.py` 14/14 fail (AsyncMock fixture defect — D-06) | `RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md` §4.2 |
| 4 | `tests/context/test_tenant_context_contract.py::TestCrossLayerContextValidation` 5 failures — L2 & L4 do not validate tenant context as contract expects | This run §4 row 3 |
| 5 | 4 collection errors in `services/layer6-benchmarks/.venv` for `value_fabric.layer6` import | This run §4 row 6 |
| 6 | Architecture conformance suite 3 failures (D-01, D-02, L3 shim) | This run §4 row 2 |
| 7 | 4 L3 contract collection errors (`test_entity_contract`, `test_l3_provenance_audit_contract`, `test_l3_route_alias_parity`, `test_layer3_graph_deprecation_contract`) | Prior audit §4.2 P1-3 |
| 8 | `packages/shared/.../mcp_gateway/tests/unit/test_mcp_gateway_unit.py` has 11 skip markers (single hot file) | §3.4 |
| 9 | `services/api` `tests/` directory has no `unit/`, `integration/`, or `contract/` subdirectories — flat 10-file layout | §3.1 |
| 10 | 179 skipped tests in baseline `tests/contract` run without live services | Prior audit §3 row 3 |

## 8. Remediation Backlog

### M0 — Pre-pilot (this week)

Aligns with `RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md` §8 M0:

1. **Fix L5 `TruthObject` tenant scoping** (already in M0-2 of release audit). Add in-tree `services/layer5-ground-truth/tests/test_tenant_isolation.py`.
2. **Fix Redis cache fixture** (M0-4 of release audit). Lifts root `tests/cache` from 0/14 → 14/14.
3. **Pin or isolate schemathesis from xdist.** Add `-p no:xdist` for `tests/contract` *and* `tests/security/test_rls_enforcement.py`; or pin `schemathesis` to a version compatible with current `pytest-xdist`.
4. **Repair L6 service venv canonical imports.** Either `pip install -e .` of `value_fabric` namespace into each service venv, or fix `services/layer6-benchmarks/conftest.py` to add the canonical path. Lifts L6 from F/22 to at least C/55.

### M1 — Coverage parity (next sprint)

5. **Add in-tree hostile-tenant tests** to `services/api`, `services/layer2-extraction`, `services/layer3-knowledge`, `services/layer5-ground-truth`, `services/layer6-benchmarks`. One file per service named `test_tenant_isolation.py`. Mirror patterns from `services/layer4-agents/tests/test_tenant_isolation.py`.
6. **Lift `apps/web` to ≥70% line coverage.** Priority targets: `value-pilot/store/pilotStore.ts`, `value-pilot/components/ValuePilotLayout.tsx`, the 5 zero-coverage workflow pages. Existing patterns in `apps/web/src/pages/InspectSetup.test.tsx` (94.5%) are a clean template.
7. **Standardize test directory layout per service**: each `services/*/tests` should have `unit/`, `integration/`, and `contract/` subdirectories. Today only L1 and L4 have any tier directories.
8. **Add named drift regression tests for D-04..D-09** from the release readiness drift register. Currently only D-01..D-03, D-06 have direct regressions.

### M2 — Post-GA hygiene

9. **Raise `tests/e2e` from 3 → ≥10 files** covering the 7-step Value Engine workflow end-to-end.
10. **Raise `tests/state` from 1 file** — `gate-state` is a blocking gate per `.fabric/prod-gates.policy.yaml`; single-file coverage is structurally fragile.
11. **Add `tenant_id` assertions to `packs/*/tests`** so pack-loading respects tenant boundaries.
12. **Make `mandatory-security-regression` a required GitHub status check** (carried from release audit M0-6).

---

## 9. Methodology & Reproducibility

```bash
# Inventory (no install required)
python -m pytest --collect-only -q tests/ services/layer4-agents/tests --no-mandatory-dep-check

# Determinism marker scan
rg -l "@pytest\.mark\.(skip|xfail|flaky|skipif)" --glob "**/tests/**/*.py"

# Hostile-tenant footprint
rg -l "tenant.*isolat|cross.tenant|tenant.*boundar|fail.*closed.*tenant" --glob "**/tests/**/*.py"

# Frontend coverage (only fully-trustworthy coverage on this host)
pnpm --dir apps/web exec vitest run --coverage

# Backend coverage (per service venv — currently env-blocked for most services)
services/<layerN>/.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest tests --cov=src --cov-branch --cov-report=json:reports/coverage/<layerN>.json
```

**Re-audit cadence:** rerun this rubric after each M0/M1 milestone closure; expect 5–10 point Total gains per service after Sec-5/Sec-6/Sec-7 above land.

## 10. Evidence Index

- This audit: `reports/TEST_COVERAGE_RUBRIC_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md`
- Baseline: `reports/RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md`
- Prior assessment: `reports/PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_2026-05-05.md`
- Vitest run log (gitignored): `reports/coverage/vitest.log`
- Drift register (cross-ref): `RELEASE_READINESS_AUDIT_2026-05-12.md` §6
- AGENTS.md invariants tested: §6 (tenant) via `tests/security/`, `tests/context/`, `tests/arch/test_tenant_architecture.py`; §4 (contract) via `tests/contract/`, `apps/web/src/api/__tests__/contract/`, `packages/eslint-plugin-fabric-contracts/src/rules/__tests__/`; §11 (layer rules) via `tests/arch/`.

*Audit generated 2026-05-12 from a Windows host. Backend coverage numbers are graded by test-to-source ratio + execution-readiness signal rather than measured `--cov` output because most service venvs cannot import the canonical `value_fabric.layerN` namespace on this checkout. A Linux CI re-run with `-p no:xdist` for schemathesis suites would replace the structural scores in Dim-1 with measured numbers.*

---

## 11. M0 Follow-Up — Remediation Results (2026-05-12)

Implemented per plan `~/.windsurf/plans/m0-remediation-0bf2cb.md`. Live validation on the same Windows host.

### Per-item outcomes

| # | Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | L5 `TruthObject` tenant scoping | **Done** | `tests/arch/test_tenant_architecture.py::test_layer5_truth_object_uses_tenant_id` now **passes** (was failing). 4 L5 model classes migrated to `Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(...)` style. In-tree hostile-tenant coverage already exists via `services/layer5-ground-truth/tests/test_cross_tenant_hostile.py` + `test_tenant_id_consistency.py` + `test_api_tenant_propagation.py`, so a duplicate `test_tenant_isolation.py` was not added. |
| 2 | Redis cache fixture | **Partial** | Added `tests/cache/conftest.py::make_redis_mock` covering `zcard`/`zremrangebyscore`/`zrange` int defaults; replaced 14 bare `AsyncMock()` instantiations. **1 of 14** tests now passes (was 0). The remaining 13 failures are *not* fixture defects — they're semantic mismatches (e.g. `test_rate_limit_keys_include_tenant_id` asserts 2 `zadd` calls but `_check_window` is invoked once per window × 3 windows × 2 tenants = 6). These need test-vs-implementation reconciliation by the rate-limiter owner; outside M0 scope per AGENTS.md §14 ("do not weaken validation to make tests pass"). |
| 3 | Schemathesis × xdist isolation | **Done** | Removed global `-n auto` from `pytest.ini:22` (now opt-in). Added `no_parallel` marker. Added `tests/contract/conftest.py::pytest_collection_modifyitems` auto-marking. **Result:** `tests/security/test_rls_enforcement.py` is back to **12/12 passing** for the RLS isolation cases (was 0/12 with xdist crash). 1 unrelated failure in the same file (`test_remediation_migrations_do_not_reintroduce_null_visibility`) is a separate migration-content issue. |
| 4 | L6 venv canonical-import repair | **Partial** | Added repo root (`"../.."`) to pythonpath in `services/{layer6-benchmarks,layer5-ground-truth,layer2-extraction,api}/pyproject.toml`. Added belt-and-braces `sys.path` fallback in `services/layer6-benchmarks/tests/conftest.py`. Extended L6 conftest env defaults with `JWT_SECRET`/`API_KEY_HMAC_SECRET`/`SERVICE_AUTH_SECRET`/`DATABASE_URL`. **Restored** the L6 canonical API modules (`value_fabric/layer6/api/{__init__.py,main.py,deps.py,schemas.py,routes/*}`) from commit `0426a06b` — commit `fc1b3148` had reduced them to circular self-importing 3-line shims that broke all imports. **Collection went from 4 errors → 1 error** (40 tests collected vs. 9 originally). Remaining error blocked by pre-existing platform-wide drift: `value_fabric.shared.identity.dependencies` imports a missing `validate_jwt_config` from `value_fabric.shared.security.config` — outside M0 scope. |

| `tests/security/test_rls_enforcement.py` (RLS isolation cases) | 0/12 (xdist crash) | **12/12** |
| `tests/arch/test_tenant_architecture.py` (L5 row) | fail | **pass** |
| `tests/cache/test_redis_tenant_isolation.py` | 0/14 (TypeError) | 1/14 (remaining are semantic mismatches now visible) |
| L6 service collection errors | 4 | 1 |

### Surfaced drift findings (out of M0 scope, logged for follow-up)

- **D-NEW-1:** `value_fabric.shared.security.config` is missing `validate_jwt_config`, but `value_fabric.shared.identity.dependencies:122` imports it. Blocks any service venv that loads the identity package via `__init__`. Affects L5, L6, and likely L1–L4.
- **D-NEW-2:** Commit `fc1b3148` ("Expand frontend contract tests…") deleted ~545 lines from each of `services/layer6-benchmarks/src/api/main.py` and `value_fabric/layer6/api/main.py` and replaced them with mutually-circular wildcard re-exports. The L6 service had no working app entry until the M0 restore above. The mirrored-files drift guard in `docs/reference/layer3-layer6-wrapper-policy.md` did not catch this.
- **D-NEW-3:** `tests/cache/test_redis_tenant_isolation.py` mocks `zcount` while production `TenantRateLimiter._check_window` uses `zcard` and `zremrangebyscore` (`packages/shared/src/value_fabric/shared/rate_limiting/tenant_rate_limiter.py:311,318`). The fixture fix in M0-2 routes around this for instantiation, but the assertion-level mismatches remain.
- **D-NEW-4:** `apps/web/package.json:62-65` contains live merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< ours` / `>>>>>>> theirs`). Caught by `tests/arch/test_no_merge_markers.py` but not gated in CI for this branch.

### Files touched (PR-style change set)

- `pytest.ini` — removed `-n auto`, added `no_parallel` marker.
- `tests/contract/conftest.py` — auto-mark `no_parallel`.
- `tests/cache/conftest.py` — new, `make_redis_mock` helper.
- `tests/cache/test_redis_tenant_isolation.py` — use `make_redis_mock()` factory.
- `services/layer5-ground-truth/src/layer5_ground_truth/models/truth_object.py` — `Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(...)` for `tenant_id` × 4 classes; added `mapped_column` import.
- `services/layer6-benchmarks/pyproject.toml` — pythonpath += `"../.."`.
- `services/layer6-benchmarks/tests/conftest.py` — sys.path fallback + extended `_TEST_ENV_DEFAULTS`.
- `services/layer5-ground-truth/pyproject.toml`, `services/layer2-extraction/pyproject.toml`, `services/api/pyproject.toml` — pythonpath repo-root broadcast fix.
- `value_fabric/layer6/api/{__init__.py,main.py,deps.py,schemas.py,routes/__init__.py,routes/benchmarks.py,routes/system.py}` — restored from `0426a06b`.

### Predicted vs. actual rubric delta

The plan predicted L5 F/38→C/55, L6 F/22→C/55. Until D-NEW-1 (`validate_jwt_config`) is fixed, neither service venv can produce measured `--cov` numbers, so the structural Dim-1 scores cannot yet be replaced with measured numbers. Re-score after D-NEW-1 lands.
