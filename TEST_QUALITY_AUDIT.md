## Issues by Severity

### P0 - Critical (0 issues found)
✅ No critical test quality issues identified

### P1 - Material (0 issues found)
✅ **FIXED:** `tests/quarantine/test_l4_frontend_contract.py` - Un-quarantined

**Resolution:** 
- Removed skip marker from `tests/contract/test_l4_frontend_contract.py`
- Deleted duplicate from `tests/quarantine/`
- Test doesn't actually require Docker - it validates JSON schemas and AST-parses Python source
- Updated quarantine README

Date Fixed: 2026-04-26

---

#### ✅ FIXED: Missing Layer 5 and 6 Tests
**Severity:** P1 → RESOLVED
**Type:** Makefile configuration gap
**Files:** `Makefile`

**Finding:** Layer 5 and Layer 6 HAVE tests but `test-layer6` was missing from Makefile.

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added `test-layer5` and `test-layer6` to main `test` target
2. Created `test-layer6` target for Layer 6 benchmarks
3. Added edge case tests to Layer 6: `test_benchmark_edge_cases.py`

**New Layer 6 Tests:**
- `TestBenchmarkValidation` - Input validation (422 errors)
- `TestBenchmarkEdgeCases` - Boundary conditions
- `TestBenchmarkNotFoundHandling` - 404 scenarios

---

### P2 - Improvement (3 issues found)

#### Issue 1: Test Naming Consistency
**Severity:** P2
**Type:** Maintainability
**Scope:** Multiple files

**Finding:** Some tests use pattern `test_<function>_<condition>()` while others use `test_<function>_<condition>_<expected>()`.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Good: `test_logprob_confidence_from_response_returns_none_without_logprobs`
- ⚠️ Could improve: `test_celery_app_name` → `test_celery_app_named_layer1_ingestion`

**Recommendation:** Standardize on behavior-focused naming: `test_<action>_<condition>_<expected>`

---

#### ✅ FIXED: Implementation Coupling in Interface Tests
**Severity:** P2 → RESOLVED
**Type:** Implementation coupling
**File:** `value-fabric/layer4-agents/tests/test_interfaces_exports.py`

**Finding:** `test_http_benchmark_client_close_is_safe_without_open_client` asserted on internal state (`assert client._client is None`).

**Fix:** Changed assertion to behavior-focused test - success means no exception raised when calling `close()` on unopened client. The test now verifies the contract (safe to call close) not the implementation detail (internal client state).

Date Fixed: 2026-04-26

---

#### Issue 3: Layer 6 Test Coverage Gap
**Severity:** P2
**Type:** Missing coverage
**File:** `value-fabric/layer6-benchmarks/tests/`

**Finding:** Original `test_benchmark_api.py` only had basic happy-path tests.

**Fix Applied:**
Created `test_benchmark_edge_cases.py` with:
- 9 new tests covering validation and edge cases
- `TestBenchmarkValidation` - Invalid inputs, missing fields
- `TestBenchmarkEdgeCases` - Zero values, large values, precision
- `TestBenchmarkNotFoundHandling` - 404 scenarios

---

## Rewrite Priority Queue

### P1 - Material (Fix Soon)
✅ All P1 issues resolved

### P2 - Improvement (Nice to Have)
1. [ ] Standardize test naming across repository
2. [ ] Add docstrings to test helper functions in `test_llm_extractor.py`

### ✅ Completed (2026-04-26)
1. [x] ~~Un-quarantine `test_l4_frontend_contract.py`~~ - Test enabled, quarantine duplicate removed
2. [x] ~~Convert implementation assertions to behavior assertions~~ - Fixed `test_http_benchmark_client_close_is_safe_without_open_client`
3. [x] ~~Add tests for Layer 5 (Ground Truth)~~ - Already had tests, added to `make test`
4. [x] ~~Add tests for Layer 6 (Benchmarks)~~ - Added `test-layer6` target + 9 new edge case tests

---

## Safe Rewrite Candidates

### Rewrite Ready: None Required

All tests are of sufficient quality that no urgent rewrites are needed. Focus should be on:
1. ✅ ~~Adding missing coverage (Layer 5, 6)~~ - COMPLETED
2. Un-quarantining environment-dependent tests
3. Standardizing naming conventions for new tests

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
✅ **All immediate actions completed:**
1. ~~Add Layer 5 and 6 tests~~ - Tests exist, now included in `make test`
2. ~~Un-quarantine L4 frontend contract test~~ - Test enabled (was incorrectly quarantined, doesn't need Docker)
3. ~~Fix implementation coupling~~ - Interface tests now behavior-focused

### Short-term (This Sprint)
1. **Standardize naming** - Adopt `test_<action>_<condition>_<expected>` for new tests
2. **Add coverage badges** - Document current coverage per layer

### Long-term
1. **Coverage gates** - Enforce 80% coverage in CI (already configured)
2. **Mutation testing** - Consider adding mutmut for test quality validation
