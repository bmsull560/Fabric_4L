## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js ≥ 22.12.0 and pnpm 10.18.1
- Docker + Docker Compose
- `make`

### First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set JWT_SECRET and the provider key(s) you use for local dev: OPENAI_API_KEY and/or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; use LAYER4_TOGETHER_API_KEY for Layer4 Together access

# 2. Enable pnpm via corepack (do not use npm/yarn)
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.18.1 --activate

# 3. Install frontend dependencies
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# 4. Install Python service dependencies into the pytest pipx venv
make setup

# 5. Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, Keycloak)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# 6. Run database migrations
make migrate

# 7. Verify everything passes
make verify
```

---

## Dev Server

```bash
# Local Docker Compose stack (frontend + supporting backend services defined in docker-compose.dev.yml)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Frontend only (Vite, port 3001, with mock API)
pnpm --dir apps/web run dev

# Frontend against live backend services
pnpm --dir apps/web run dev:live
# Requires: VITE_API_BASE_URL, VITE_PROXY_L1_URL … VITE_PROXY_L6_URL
```

---

## Build

```bash
# Frontend production build
pnpm --dir apps/web run build

```

---

## PR Requirements

### Branch naming

No enforced pattern is documented; use descriptive names (e.g., `feat/layer4-checkpoint-resume`, `fix/tenant-isolation-l3`).

### Commit format

Follow conventional commits where possible. Co-author AI-assisted commits:

```
Co-authored-by: Ona <no-reply@ona.com>
```

### Required CI checks (`.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`)

All PRs targeting `main` must pass:

- `structural-preflight` — import topology, Python contract lint, frontend root policy
- `package-manager-policy` — pnpm-only enforcement
- Per-layer lint, typecheck, and test jobs
- `contract-compliance` — OpenAPI drift detection
- `security-gates` — secret guardrails, tenant isolation
- `verify-gate` — `make verify` equivalent

### PR body

Fill in the required sections from `.github/pull_request_template.md`:

- **Governance Impact** — contract shape, tenant isolation, compatibility shim impact
- **Release & Policy Checklist** — contracts updated, API versioning, DR runbooks
- **Validation** — confirm `make verify` passed; `make evals` for agent/prompt changes

## Architecture Rules

The sections below define the invariants every agent and contributor must preserve.

---

## 1. Core Operating Principles

### Act like a senior platform engineer

Before changing code:

- Understand the relevant layer, service boundary, and source-of-truth path.
- Prefer small, targeted changes over broad rewrites.
- Preserve existing architecture unless explicitly asked to refactor.
- Do not introduce new frameworks, package managers, UI libraries, or runtime patterns without justification.
- Always check for contract drift, schema drift, tenant-isolation impact, and frontend design-system impact.

### Do not optimize for "it works locally"

A change is not complete unless it respects:

- Multi-tenant isolation
- API contracts
- Layer boundaries
- Runtime source-of-truth paths
- Security and governance expectations
- Testability
- Observability where applicable
- Frontend design governance if touching `apps/web/`

---

## 2. Platform Architecture Context

Value Fabric uses a six-layer pipeline:

```text
Frontend: React / Vite / TanStack Query / Zustand / Tailwind / shadcn/ui

Layer 1: Intelligent Data Ingestion Service
- Port: 8001
- Responsibilities: Playwright crawling, Celery jobs, Redis queues, PostgreSQL state, compliance-aware ingestion

Layer 2: Ontology-Guided Extraction Pipeline
- Port: 8002
- Responsibilities: Pydantic v2 extraction, LLM extraction, RDF/OWL generation, provenance, batch ingest

Layer 3: Knowledge Graph & Semantic Layer
- Port: 8003
- Responsibilities: Neo4j, GraphRAG, hybrid retrieval, pgvector, subgraph APIs

Layer 4: Agentic Workflow Engine
- Port: 8004
- Responsibilities: LangGraph workflows, ROI calculator, business case generation, checkpoints, agent orchestration

Layer 5: Ground Truth
- Port: 8005
- Responsibilities: TruthObject validation, maturity ladder, evidence-backed claims

Layer 6: Benchmark Service
- Port: 8006
- Responsibilities: Peer comparison, statistical validation, datasets, benchmark policies
```

When modifying any layer, preserve its responsibility. Do not move logic across layers unless explicitly instructed.

---

## 3. Source-of-Truth Paths

Use these canonical paths first.

### Runtime packages

```text
value_fabric/layer1/
value_fabric/layer2/
value_fabric/layer3/
value_fabric/layer4/
services/layer5-ground-truth/src/layer5_ground_truth/
value_fabric/layer6/
value_fabric/shared/
```

### Runtime API modules

```text
value_fabric/layer1/api/routes/
value_fabric/layer2/api/routes/
value_fabric/layer3/api/routes/
services/layer5-ground-truth/src/layer5_ground_truth/api/
value_fabric/layer6/api/routes/
```

### Maintained deployable services

```text
services/layer1-ingestion/
services/layer2-extraction/
services/layer3-knowledge/
services/layer4-agents/
services/layer5-ground-truth/
services/layer6-benchmarks/
services/api/
```

Path governance matrix for canonical vs compatibility locations:
- `docs/reference/layer-runtime-path-governance.md`

---

## 4. Contract-First Development

Contracts are the source of truth.

Before changing API behavior, data structures, tool schemas, agent outputs, or frontend expectations:

- Check `contracts/`
- Check OpenAPI specs
- Check JSON Schemas
- Check frontend API client expectations
- Check tests that assert contract behavior

Never silently change a response shape.

If a backend response changes, also update:

- OpenAPI contract
- JSON schema if applicable
- TypeScript types
- TanStack Query hooks
- UI consumers
- Tests
- Documentation if public-facing

---

## 5. Drift Prevention Rules

The hardest class of bugs in this system is architectural drift.

Always check for drift between:

- Agent logic and UI expectations
- API schemas and frontend types
- Database models and migrations
- OpenAPI specs and route handlers
- Documentation and implementation
- Tenant context and repository methods
- Layer-to-layer payload shapes

When fixing a bug, ask:

```text
Did this fail because one component changed while another still expects the old contract?
```

If yes, fix the alignment, not just the symptom.

---

## 6. Tenant Isolation Rules

Tenant isolation is a first-class invariant.

Any data read or write must be scoped by tenant context.

When touching backend code:

- Confirm `tenant_id` is extracted from authenticated context.
- Confirm `tenant_id` is passed to repository/service methods.
- Confirm queries filter by `tenant_id`.
- Confirm writes persist tenant ownership.
- Confirm tests cover hostile cross-tenant access where applicable.

Do not trust request body tenant IDs over authenticated context.

Preferred pattern:

```python
tenant_id = ctx.tenant_id
repo.method(..., tenant_id=tenant_id)
```

Avoid:

```python
tenant_id = request.tenant_id
```

unless explicitly validated against authenticated context.

---

## 7. Security and Governance Rules

Never commit secrets.

Do not weaken:

- Auth
- RBAC
- Tenant isolation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Governance middleware
- Contract validation
- Production gates

If adding a new endpoint, workflow, or agent action, consider:

- Who can call this?
- Which tenant owns the data?
- Is the action auditable?
- Is the response safe to expose?
- Does this need governance middleware?
- Does this need contract tests?
- Does this need monitoring or metrics?

---

## 8. Package Manager Rules

This monorepo is pnpm-only.

Use:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.18.1 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Do not use:

```bash
npm install
npm ci
yarn install
```

Frontend work must also use pnpm:

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/web install
pnpm --dir apps/web test
pnpm --dir apps/web build
```

Do not modify lockfiles casually.

---

## 9. Frontend Governance Rules

Before modifying `apps/web/`, read and follow:

```text
DESIGN.md
```

Frontend changes must reuse existing patterns:

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- shadcn/ui
- TanStack Query
- Zustand where existing state patterns require it

Do not create one-off UI abstractions when shared components exist.

Prefer:

- `PageShell`
- `PageHeader`
- Shared card primitives
- Existing loading, empty, and error states
- Existing shell/tab/right-rail conventions

Avoid:

- New component libraries
- Unapproved icon systems
- Inconsistent spacing
- Custom card wrappers
- One-off colors
- One-off layouts
- Vertical navigation when the established pattern is horizontal tabs

---

## 10. Frontend UX Structure

Preserve the system's preferred UX model:

- Top-level domains in the sidebar
- Horizontal tabs inside major workspaces
- Right rail for detail panels and agent streams
- Drilldowns through overlays, drawers, or right-side panels
- Clear status states
- Traceability from insight to evidence to value model

When building UI for agentic workflows, favor:

```text
Main workspace + right rail detail/agent panel
```

rather than scattered pages or modal-heavy flows.

---

## 11. Layer-Specific Rules

### Layer 1: Ingestion

When changing ingestion:

- Preserve job lifecycle semantics.
- Keep crawling, extraction preparation, compliance, and source tracking separate.
- Ensure ingestion jobs are tenant-scoped.
- Do not bypass queue/state management.
- Preserve provenance metadata for downstream layers.

### Layer 2: Extraction

When changing extraction:

- Preserve ontology-guided extraction.
- Use Pydantic v2 patterns.
- Preserve provenance.
- Maintain RDF/OWL compatibility where applicable.
- Do not emit unstructured blobs where structured entities are expected.

### Layer 3: Knowledge Graph

When changing graph or retrieval:

- Preserve Neo4j entity relationships.
- Preserve hybrid retrieval behavior.
- Keep graph query APIs contract-aligned.
- Confirm tenant filters exist in graph queries.
- Avoid breaking GraphRAG, subgraph, and entity context consumers.

### Layer 4: Agents

When changing agents:

- Treat prompts, tools, skills, and workflow state as versioned architecture.
- Preserve checkpoint/resume behavior.
- Keep provider-specific logic out of core orchestration.
- Do not couple LangGraph workflows directly to one LLM vendor.
- Ensure agent outputs match contracts consumed by the UI and downstream services.

### Layer 5: Ground Truth

When changing validation:

- Preserve TruthObject semantics.
- Claims must remain evidence-backed.
- Maturity ladder logic must be auditable.
- Do not weaken validation to make tests pass.
- Ensure tenant context is propagated into repository calls.

### Layer 6: Benchmarks

When changing benchmarks:

- Preserve benchmark dataset lineage.
- Keep peer comparison and statistical validation explicit.
- Ensure all dataset, compare, validate, and industry-list operations are tenant-scoped where required.
- Do not mix benchmark definitions with tenant-specific benchmark usage unless the model explicitly supports it.

---

## 12. Agent and Provider Rules

Core orchestration must remain provider-agnostic.

Provider-specific code belongs in adapters.

Do not hardcode:

- OpenAI-only logic
- Anthropic-only logic
- Together-only logic
- Model-specific assumptions
- Vendor-specific response structures in core workflows

Use adapter boundaries.

Agents should produce structured, versioned outputs.

---

## 13. Packs and Ontology Rules

Packs are domain extensions.

They may include:

- Ontologies
- Formulas
- Variables
- Benchmarks
- Personas
- Industry-specific value drivers

Do not modify core platform logic to hardcode a pack-specific assumption.

Instead, prefer:

```text
core platform capability + pack-provided configuration
```

A manufacturing value driver, SaaS ROI formula, healthcare benchmark, or public-sector maturity model should usually live in a pack, not in core orchestration.

---

## 14. Testing Rules

Every meaningful change should include or preserve tests.

Prioritize:

- Unit tests for pure logic
- Integration tests for service boundaries
- Contract tests for API shapes
- Tenant-isolation tests for data access
- Regression tests for drift fixes
- Frontend behavior tests over brittle CSS tests
- E2E tests only where workflow coverage matters

For security-sensitive changes, include hostile tests.

Examples:

```text
Tenant A cannot read Tenant B data.
Tenant A cannot mutate Tenant B data.
Missing tenant context fails closed.
Invalid contract payload is rejected.
Agent output schema mismatch is caught.
```

Do not remove failing tests unless they are demonstrably obsolete and replaced with better coverage.

---

## 15. Validation Commands

Use the narrowest validation first, then broaden.

Examples:

```bash
# Frontend
pnpm --dir apps/web test
pnpm --dir apps/web build

# Full install
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Python tests
pytest path/to/relevant/tests

# Contract tests
pytest tests/contract

# Security tests
pytest tests/security

# Platform verification
make verify
```

If validation cannot be run, clearly report:

- What was changed
- What validation was attempted
- What could not be validated
- Why
- Residual risk

---

## 16. Documentation Rules

Update documentation when changing:

- Public APIs
- Layer responsibilities
- Setup commands
- Environment variables
- Operational runbooks
- Agent behavior
- Contract shapes
- Governance requirements
- Production-readiness checks

Docs should follow the repository's Diataxis structure:

- Tutorials
- How-to guides
- Reference
- Explanations

Do not create random documentation locations if a canonical docs area exists.

---

## 17. Environment and Secrets Rules

Never commit real secrets.

Use:

```text
.env
.env.example
OIDC in CI
ExternalSecrets / Vault in production
```

When adding environment variables:

- Add them to `.env.example`
- Document them
- Ensure safe defaults
- Avoid insecure production defaults
- Ensure tests and Docker Compose files are aligned

Do not rename environment variables without updating all consumers.

---

---

## 22. Migration Rules

When modifying database models:

- Do not change models without migrations.
- Do not change migrations without checking existing deployed state.
- Preserve tenant fields.
- Prefer additive migrations where possible.
- Avoid destructive migrations unless explicitly required.
- Include downgrade only if repository convention requires it.
- Check service-specific Alembic setup before assuming a global migration path.

---

## 23. Error Handling Rules

Errors should be explicit, safe, and contract-aligned.

Do not expose:

- Secrets
- Stack traces
- Internal tokens
- Raw provider responses
- Cross-tenant data
- Sensitive customer content

Prefer structured errors with stable codes.

---

## 24. Observability Rules

For production-impacting workflows, preserve or add:

- Request IDs
- Structured logs
- Metrics
- Audit events
- Runbook links where applicable
- Clear failure modes

Do not remove existing observability to simplify code.

---

## 25. Pull Request / Final Response Format

When finishing work, report:

```markdown
## Summary

- What changed
- Why it changed
- Which files were touched

## Validation

- Commands run
- Tests passed
- Tests not run and why

## Risk / Follow-up

- Any residual risk
- Any contract or migration concern
- Any manual verification needed
```

Do not claim tests passed unless they were actually run.

---

## 26. Non-Negotiables

Never:

- Use `npm install` or `yarn install`
- Bypass tenant isolation
- Silently change API response shapes
- Hardcode provider-specific logic into core orchestration
- Ignore `DESIGN.md` when editing frontend
- Introduce a new UI library casually
- Remove tests just to pass CI
- Commit secrets
- Weaken governance middleware
- Mix pack-specific logic into core platform
- Treat documentation as separate from implementation
- Make broad rewrites when a targeted fix is sufficient

---

## 27. Default Reasoning Loop

For every task, follow this loop:

```text
1. Locate the canonical source-of-truth files.
2. Understand the layer and contract boundary.
3. Identify likely drift points.
4. Make the smallest safe change.
5. Update contracts/types/tests/docs if needed.
6. Validate with targeted commands.
7. Report what changed, what passed, and what risk remains.
```

---

## 28. North Star

Value Fabric must remain:

- Contract-first
- Tenant-safe
- Layered
- Auditable
- Provider-agnostic
- Pack-extensible
- Frontend-governed
- Production-ready
- Drift-resistant

Optimize for long-term platform integrity over short-term patching.
