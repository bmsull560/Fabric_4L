# Code Boundary Enforcement Workflow

This workflow ensures the codebase maintains clear separation between internal domains, external dependencies, and system layers to maximize maintainability, testability, and security.

## The Seven Boundary Types

This workflow enforces **seven distinct boundary types** that protect system integrity at different scopes:

| Boundary | Scope | Violation Symptom | Healthy Signal |
|----------|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Module** | Code organization | Build pulls in internal paths from sibling modules | Module builds independently; imports are internal or from shared, stable packages |
| **Build** | Build process | Docker context = entire repo; language A build breaks due to language B errors | Each service has its own build; no cross-service dependencies in build step |
| **Runtime** | Execution | One service crash cascades to downstream failures | Services depend on network contracts only; graceful degradation on dependency failure |
| **Deployment** | Infrastructure | Cannot roll one layer without rolling others | Each layer is its own Deployment/image; independently rollable |
| **Data** | Information flow | Shared internal objects between layers; implicit schema assumptions | Well-defined schemas; versioned contracts; explicit data transformation at boundaries |
| **Dependency** | Package/imports | One service's dependencies pollute another's build | Dependencies limited to declared runtime requirements |
| **Interface** | API/contracts | Other layers rely on implementation details | Clean HTTP API/message contract; swappable implementations; testable in isolation |

## When to Use

- Creating new modules, functions, or classes
- Reviewing code for architectural integrity
- Refactoring to improve separation of concerns
- Integrating external APIs or databases
- **Before fixing build issues (check Build/Dependency boundaries first)**
- **When a service fails due to unrelated code changes (boundary breach)**
- **When a build breaks due to errors in a different language stack or module**
- Before marking a task as complete
- When code review reveals boundary violations
- Periodic boundary hardening audits

## When to Stop

- All boundary definitions documented and validated
- No boundary smells remain (P0/P1 issues resolved)
- Test doubles replace all external dependencies in unit tests
- Static analysis passes with no boundary violations
- Time budget exhausted (can be refined in follow-up)

## Steps

1. **Define the Boundaries**
   // turbo
   For every module, function, or class, explicitly document:
   - **The Contract**: What inputs are accepted (validated at boundary) and what outputs are guaranteed
   - **The Ownership**: Which layer owns this logic (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Interface)
   - **The Dependencies**: What external systems or modules this code interacts with (and how interactions are isolated)

2. **Audit External Boundaries**
   Check each boundary type against these protocols:

   **Database Boundaries:**
   - [ ] All queries isolated in Repository/DAO classes (never in domain logic)
   - [ ] Use DTOs or Entities to cross boundary—never pass raw database rows upstream
   - [ ] Transaction boundaries managed at application service layer
   - [ ] Database exceptions translated to domain exceptions at boundary

   **Third-Party API Boundaries:**
   - [ ] Adapter pattern implemented: Interface with concrete adapter (e.g., `ExternalPaymentGateway` → `StripePaymentAdapter`)
   - [ ] HTTP clients wrapped in dedicated gateway classes (no raw fetch/axios in business logic)
   - [ ] External responses validated and sanitized immediately upon entry
   - [ ] Circuit breakers and timeouts configured at adapter level
   - [ ] External data formats mapped to internal domain models within adapter (anti-corruption layer)

   **File System/OS Boundaries:**
   - [ ] File I/O abstracted behind interfaces (`FileStorage` with `LocalFileSystem` and `S3Storage` implementations)
   - [ ] Path traversal prevention: Validate file paths at entry points using `^` and `$` regex anchors
   - [ ] Resource cleanup guaranteed via try-with-resources or equivalent patterns

   **Input Validation Boundaries (Security Critical):**
   - [ ] Validate at outermost layer using strict patterns:
     - Regex anchors: Use `^pattern$` not `pattern`
     - Type coercion: Reject unexpected types immediately
     - Length limits: Enforce maximums to prevent DoS
   - [ ] Sanitize on entry, encode on exit (HTML, SQL, shell context-aware)
   - [ ] Never pass raw user input to system calls, SQL concatenation, or eval

3. **Audit System Boundaries (Layer/Service Level)**
   // turbo
   Verify the seven architectural boundaries for each layer/service:

   **Build Boundary:**
   - [ ] Can build service from its own directory without unrelated code
   - [ ] Docker context narrowed to service directory (not entire monorepo)
   - [ ] Build steps isolated per service (no cross-service compilation)
   - [ ] CI pipeline builds layers independently in parallel

   **Module Boundary:**
   - [ ] Layer is self-contained; no imports from sibling layers' internal paths
   - [ ] Shared code lives in `shared/` or published packages only
   - [ ] No references to sibling module internal paths (e.g., importing UI components into API services)

   **Dependency Boundary:**
   - [ ] Runtime dependencies match declared requirements (no surprise imports)
   - [ ] Cross-stack packages absent (e.g., UI packages in backend, server packages in frontend)
   - [ ] Test utilities from other modules not imported in production code

   **Runtime Boundary:**
   - [ ] Service communicates via network contracts (HTTP/API/messages) only
   - [ ] No assumptions about other services' process models or threading
   - [ ] Graceful degradation when dependencies unavailable

   **Deployment Boundary:**
   - [ ] Each layer is its own Kubernetes Deployment with independent image
   - [ ] Can roll one layer without affecting others
   - [ ] Health checks isolated per service

   **Data Boundary:**
   - [ ] Layer-to-layer communication uses versioned schemas (OpenAPI, JSON Schema)
   - [ ] Data transformations happen at boundary, not leaked into business logic
   - [ ] Pipeline stages (L2→L3→L4) have explicit contract definitions

   **Interface Boundary:**
   - [ ] HTTP API or message contract is the only dependency other layers rely on
   - [ ] Implementation can be swapped without consumer changes
   - [ ] Testable with contract tests/mocks in isolation

4. **Audit Internal Boundaries (Code Level)**
   Verify layer and module boundaries:

   **Layer Boundaries (Clean Architecture/Hexagonal):**
   - [ ] Dependencies point inward only: Domain knows nothing of Application
   - [ ] Dependency Inversion: Domain defines interfaces, Infrastructure implements them
   - [ ] No domain logic in controllers or data access layers

   **Module/Namespace Boundaries:**
   - [ ] Explicit exports (whitelist approach): Only expose intended public APIs
   - [ ] Cross-module communication via published interfaces only
   - [ ] Event-driven boundaries: Use domain events for loose coupling between bounded contexts

   **Function/Method Boundaries (Single Responsibility):
   - [ ] One Reason to Change: Function does one thing; if "and" appears in name, split it
   - [ ] Limit Side Effects: Pure functions preferred; side effects explicit in naming
   - [ ] Parameter Count: Max 3-4 parameters (use parameter objects beyond this)
   - [ ] Return Consistency: Return same types (don't mix `User`, `null`, `false`)

4. **Fix Boundary Violations (P0/P1 Priority)**
   // turbo
   Transform violations into proper boundaries:

   **P0 - Critical (Fix Immediately):**
   - **Build boundary breach**: Service build fails due to unrelated code (cross-language/cross-module errors) → Narrow Docker context, isolate build
   - **Dependency boundary breach**: Packages from one stack in another service's build (e.g., frontend packages in backend) → Clean up dependencies, remove cross-module imports
   - **Module boundary breach**: Importing from sibling module's internal paths → Move to shared/ or use public interface only
   - SQL injection or raw queries in business logic → Extract Repository class
   - Raw HTTP calls in domain code → Implement Adapter pattern
   - Input validation after business logic → Move validation to boundary entry
   - Regex without anchors → Add `^` and `$` anchors
   - Secrets/credentials in logs → Sanitize at boundary

   **P1 - High Priority:**
   - **Runtime boundary fragile**: Service assumes other service's implementation details → Add circuit breaker, use contract testing
   - **Data boundary implicit**: Shared internal objects between layers → Define explicit schema, add transformation layer
   - Hardcoded strings/numbers in boundary code → Extract constants
   - No retry logic on external calls → Add circuit breaker at adapter
   - Direct dependency instantiation → Inject via constructor
   - Missing type coercion at validation → Add strict type checks

   **Example Transformation:**
   ```javascript
   // ❌ Boundary Violation:
   function processOrder(orderData) {
     const user = db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${orderData.userId}`);
     const payment = await fetch('https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges', {...});
     fs.writeFileSync('receipts/' + orderData.id + '.txt', ...);
   }

   // ✅ Boundary Respecting:
   class OrderProcessor {
     constructor(userRepo, paymentGateway, receiptStore) {
       this.userRepo = userRepo;
       this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
       this.receiptStore = receiptStore;
     }
     async process(orderData) {
       const validatedOrder = OrderValidator.validate(orderData);
       const user = await this.userRepo.findById(validatedOrder.userId);
       const payment = await this.paymentGateway.charge(user, validatedOrder.amount);
       if (payment.isSuccessful()) {
         await this.receiptStore.save(payment.receipt);
         return Result.success(payment);
       }
       return Result.failure(payment.error);
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Verify Testability**
   // turbo
   Ensure boundaries support proper testing:

   - [ ] **Mockability**: External dependencies replaceable with test doubles without code changes
   - [ ] **Interface-Based Testing**: Unit tests target interfaces, not concrete implementations
   - [ ] **Boundary Testing**: Verify code handles external contract violations (timeouts, malformed data, nulls)
   - [ ] **No Real Services in Unit Tests**: Database, HTTP calls, file system faked/isolated

   **Test Double Strategy:**
   - [ ] **Stubs**: For providing fixed data to drive code under test
   - [ ] **Mocks**: For verifying interactions across boundaries
   - [ ] **Fakes**: Lightweight in-memory implementations for integration testing
   - [ ] **Spies**: For capturing boundary-crossing data for verification

6. **Detect and Fix Boundary Smells**
   Scan for red flags and refactor:

   **Immediate Red Flags:**
   - [ ] **Leaky Abstractions**: Internal data structures exposed in public method signatures
   - [ ] **Temporal Coupling**: Method B must be called immediately after Method A
   - [ ] **Feature Envy**: Method in Class A reaching into private state of Class B
   - [ ] **Shotgun Surgery**: One change requires edits in 5+ files
   - [ ] **Global State**: Static variables bypassing explicit boundaries

   **Security Smells:**
   - [ ] Input validation after business logic processing
   - [ ] Regex without anchors allowing substring bypasses
   - [ ] Type juggling at security boundaries

7. **Document Boundaries**
   // turbo
   For each boundary crossing, document:
   ```markdown
   ## Boundary: [Module A] ↔ [Module B]
   - **Contract**: [Interface definition or API spec]
   - **Data Format**: [JSON Schema, Protobuf, or Type definitions]
   - **Error Handling**: [How failures are propagated/retried]
   - **Ownership**: [Team/Module responsible for maintenance]
   - **SLA**: [Performance expectations at this seam]
   ```

8. **Final Review**
   // turbo
   - Run all tests to ensure nothing broke
   - Verify unit tests use mocks, not real services
   - Check that external dependencies are injectable
   - Confirm no boundary violations remain in static analysis
   - Commit with descriptive message: "Boundary: [specific enforcement made]"

## Success Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] Each layer builds independently from its own directory
- [ ] Docker context narrowed; no cross-service build dependencies
- [ ] No P0 boundary breaches (build/dependency/module/runtime)

- [ ] Committed with descriptive message explaining boundary enforcement

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### System Boundary Anti-Patterns
- **Don't**: Build a service from the entire monorepo context (violates Build boundary)
- **Don't**: Allow errors in one language stack to break builds in another (violates Dependency boundary)
- **Don't**: Import from sibling module internal paths like `../other-module/src/` (violates Module boundary)
- **Don't**: Assume other service's process model or threading (violates Runtime boundary)
- **Don't**: Roll all layers together as one unit (violates Deployment boundary)
- **Don't**: Pass raw internal objects between layers without schema (violates Data boundary)
- **Don't**: Rely on implementation details of other services (violates Interface boundary)

### Code Boundary Anti-Patterns
- **Don't**: Mix business logic with database queries or HTTP calls
- **Don't**: Pass raw user input to system calls or SQL concatenation
- **Don't**: Use regex without anchors (`/admin/i` instead of `/^admin$/i`)
- **Don't**: Expose internal data structures (HashMaps, database rows) in public APIs
- **Don't**: Allow global state to bypass explicit boundaries
- **Don't**: Validate input after business logic processing
- **Don't**: Use real services in unit tests (database, HTTP, file system)
- **Don't**: Leave TODOs for "future boundary cleanup"
