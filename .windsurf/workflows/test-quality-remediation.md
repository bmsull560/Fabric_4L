# Test Quality Remediation Workflow

A step-by-step operational workflow for auditing tests, applying targeted rewrites, executing suites, diagnosing failures, and resolving them safely.

## Overview

This workflow guides systematic test quality improvement across the Value Fabric repository. It applies to both Python/pytest (backend layers) and TypeScript/Vitest (frontend).

**Prerequisites**:
- Review `.windsurf/skills/test-quality-auditor/SKILL.md` for evaluation criteria
- Access to repository with all layers present
- Python 3.11+ and Node.js/pnpm installed

---

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Goal**: Map the complete testing landscape.

### 1.1 Identify Repository Structure
```bash
# Check for monorepo structure
ls -la services/
ls -la frontend/
```

### 1.2 Detect Test Frameworks
```bash
# Python layers
find value-fabric -name "pyproject.toml" -exec grep -l pytest {} \;
find value-fabric -name "pytest.ini" -o -name "setup.cfg"

# Frontend
cat frontend/package.json | grep -A5 "devDependencies"
```

### 1.3 Locate Test Files
```bash
# Python tests
find value-fabric -name "test_*.py" -o -name "*_test.py"

# TypeScript tests
find frontend -name "*.test.ts" -o -name "*.test.tsx" -o -name "*.spec.ts"
```

### 1.4 Identify CI/Test Scripts
```bash
# Check for GitHub Actions
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Check for Makefile, justfile, scripts
ls -la scripts/
cat package.json | grep -A10 '"scripts"'
```

### 1.5 Document Coverage Tools
```bash
# Check for coverage configuration
grep -r "pytest-cov\|coverage" services/*/pyproject.toml
grep -r "coverage\|istanbul" frontend/package.json
```

### Discovery Output
Create a concise testing map documenting:
- Frameworks per layer (pytest, Vitest, Playwright)
- Test file locations and counts
- Coverage tooling presence
- CI integration status
- Known gaps (no tests, missing coverage)

---

## Phase 2: Audit

**Goal**: Evaluate all tests against quality principles.

### 2.1 Review Skill Documentation
Read `.windsurf/skills/test-quality-auditor/SKILL.md` before starting evaluation.

### 2.2 Evaluate Each Test File

For each test file, assess:

```markdown
## File: path/to/test_file.py

### Overview
- Test count: N
- Lines of code: N
- Fixtures used: list
- External mocks: list

### Principle Scores (1-5)
| Principle | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Behavior-Focused | X | Notes |
| Clear/Readable | X | Notes |
| Focused | X | Notes |
| Deterministic | X | Notes |
| Isolated | X | Notes |
| Meaningful | X | Notes |
| Maintainable | X | Notes |
| **Total** | XX/35 | |

### Issues Found
- **P0**: Critical issues
- **P1**: Material issues
- **P2**: Improvement opportunities

### Recommended Action
- [ ] Leave as-is
- [ ] Rewrite (specify which tests)
- [ ] Add missing coverage
- [ ] Delete (with rationale)
```

### 2.3 Categorize Issues

**By Severity**:
- P0: Block release, fix immediately
- P1: Fix in this sprint
- P2: Fix opportunistically

**By Type**:
- behavior_not_implementation
- weak_naming
- mixed_concerns
- flaky_timing
- shared_state_leakage
- poor_isolation
- over_mocking
- under_asserting
- missing_edge_cases
- unreadable_setup

### 2.4 Prioritize Rewrites

Sort rewrites by:
1. P0 issues first
2. Pre-existing failures
3. Core/critical path tests
4. Most impactful P1 issues
5. P2 improvements (deferred)

### Audit Output
`artifacts/testing/test-quality-audit.md` with:
- Per-file assessments
- Categorized issues by severity
- Prioritized rewrite list
- Rationale for each recommendation

---

## Phase 3: Prioritization

**Goal**: Determine rewrite order for maximum impact.

### 3.1 Create Rewrite Queue

```markdown
## Rewrite Priority Queue

### P0 - Critical
1. [ ] test_file_x.py - Flaky state machine tests
2. [ ] test_file_y.py - Race condition in async tests

### P1 - Material
1. [ ] test_api.py - Implementation coupling in assertions
2. [ ] test_models.py - Weak naming, unclear intent

### P2 - Improvement
1. [ ] test_utils.py - Could extract common setup
```

### 3.2 Estimate Effort

For each rewrite:
- Small: < 30 min (rename, restructure)
- Medium: 30-60 min (rewrite assertions, fix isolation)
- Large: > 60 min (architectural changes, new fixtures)

### 3.3 Sequence for Safety

1. Start with tests that have no dependents
2. Fix shared fixtures before dependent tests
3. Group by related functionality
4. Leave complex refactors for last

---

## Phase 4: Rewrite

**Goal**: Execute targeted rewrites safely.

### 4.1 Before Starting Each Rewrite

**Explicitly state**:
- Principle violation
- Risk it creates
- Why rewrite is justified
- Expected outcome

### 4.2 Rewrite Process

1. **Read original test** - Understand intended coverage
2. **Identify issues** - Match against anti-patterns
3. **Draft new structure** - Plan AAA organization
4. **Implement rewrite** - Make minimal, focused changes
5. **Preserve behavior** - Ensure same regressions caught
6. **Add documentation** - Comments for complex setup

### 4.3 Rewrite Patterns

**Renaming**:
```python
# Before
def test_case_1(self): ...

# After
def test_advances_to_supported_when_confidence_above_threshold(self): ...
```

**Restructuring**:
```python
# Before - mixed concerns
def test_full_flow(self):
    # Create
    x = create()
    assert x.id
    # Update
    y = update(x)
    assert y.status
    # Delete
    delete(y)
    assert deleted

# After - focused tests
def test_creates_with_valid_data(self): ...
def test_updates_status_successfully(self): ...
def test_soft_deletes_removing_access(self): ...
```

**Fixing Isolation**:
```python
# Before - shared state
COUNTER = 0

def test_increment(self):
    global COUNTER
    COUNTER += 1
    assert COUNTER == 1  # Fails on second run!

# After - fixture-based isolation
@pytest.fixture
def counter():
    return {"value": 0}

def test_increment(self, counter):
    counter["value"] += 1
    assert counter["value"] == 1
```

**Removing Timing Flakiness**:
```python
# Before - real timing
async def test_timeout(self):
    start = time.time()
    await process()
    assert time.time() - start < 5  # Flaky!

# After - deterministic
def test_timeout(self, mock_time):
    mock_time.return_value = [0, 10]  # Mock time passage
    result = await process()
    assert result.timed_out
```

### 4.4 Post-Rewrite Checklist

- [ ] Test passes (run 5x to verify determinism)
- [ ] Name describes behavior
- [ ] AAA structure clear
- [ ] No implementation coupling
- [ ] All meaningful outcomes asserted
- [ ] Would catch intended regressions

---

## Phase 5: Validation

**Goal**: Run tests and confirm quality improvements.

### 5.1 Run Targeted Tests First

```bash
# Single file
cd services/layer5-ground-truth
pytest tests/test_state_machine.py -v

# Run 5x to verify determinism
for i in {1..5}; do pytest tests/test_state_machine.py -q; done
```

### 5.2 Run Layer-Specific Suites

```bash
# Layer 5
cd services/layer5-ground-truth && pytest -v

# Layer 3
cd services/layer3-knowledge && pytest -v

# Layer 1
cd services/layer1-ingestion && pytest -v
```

### 5.3 Run Full Suite

```bash
# If there's a root-level test runner
pytest services/

# Or per-layer combined
for layer in layer{1..5}-*; do
  echo "=== Testing $layer ==="
  (cd "services/$layer" && pytest -q)
done
```

### 5.4 Failure Triage

**For each failure, determine**:

| Category | Cause | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Rewrite Error | Bug introduced during rewrite | Fix rewrite |
| Pre-existing | Was failing before changes | Document separately |
| Flaky | Environmental/timing | Fix determinism |
| App Bug Exposed | Test correctly finds bug | Fix production code |

### 5.5 Cure Failures

**If rewrite is wrong**:
1. Re-read original test intent
2. Fix the rewrite
3. Re-run

**If production code is wrong**:
1. Verify test expresses correct intended behavior
2. Fix production code
3. Re-run

**If pre-existing failure**:
1. Document in `artifacts/testing/pre-existing-failures.md`
2. Mark with `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="pre-existing failure, ticket #X")`
3. Do not weaken assertions to "fix"

---

## Phase 6: Reporting

```

---

## Rollback and Escalation Rules

### When to Rollback

1. **Cascade of failures**: Rewrites cause >3 unrelated tests to fail
2. **Production bug introduced**: Fix would require production changes >50 lines
3. **Uncertain intent**: Cannot determine original test's purpose
4. **Time exceeded**: Rewrite estimate was wrong by >2x

**Rollback process**:
```bash
git checkout -- path/to/test_file.py
git checkout -- path/to/conftest.py
pytest tests/related/  # Verify clean state
```

### When to Escalate

1. **Architecture problem**: Issue requires framework-level changes
2. **Test design disagreement**: Unclear if test should be rewritten
3. **Production bug found**: Rewrites exposed real bugs requiring team decision
4. **Policy violation**: Test patterns violate team conventions

**Escalation process**:
1. Document in `artifacts/testing/escalation-needed.md`
2. Include: test file, issue, attempted resolution, question for team
3. Skip test if needed: `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="escalated: see #ticket")`
