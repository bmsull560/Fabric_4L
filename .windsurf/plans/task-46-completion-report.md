# Task 46 - Monitoring Readiness Completion Report

**Date:** 2026-04-12
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Static validation passed, Runtime validation pending Docker Desktop

## Summary

This task completed production monitoring and alerting wiring across Docker Compose and Kubernetes environments, with full Alertmanager integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Prometheus Configuration Fixes
**File:** `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

Fixed scrape targets to match actual Docker Compose service names:
- `layer1` → `layer1-ingestion:8000`
- `layer2` → `layer2-extraction:8000`
- `layer3` → `layer3-knowledge:8001`
- `layer4` → `layer4-agents:8000`
- `layer5` → `layer5-ground-truth:8005`
- `layer6` → `layer6-benchmarks:8006`

### 2. Alertmanager Configuration
**New File:** `monitoring/alerting/alertmanager.yml`

Created minimal working Alertmanager configuration with:
- Default routing and grouping
- Inhibit rules (critical silences warning)
- Placeholder receiver (ready for PagerDuty/Slack integration)

### 3. Docker Compose Monitoring Stack
**File:** `value-fabric/docker-compose.yml`

Added three new services:
- **prometheus** (v2.54.1): Scrapes all layer metrics
- **alertmanager** (v0.28.1): Receives and routes alerts
- **grafana** (11.2.0): Visualization with auto-provisioned dashboards

All services include:
- Proper config mounts from `monitoring/` directory
- Health checks
- Network attachment to `value-fabric-network`
- Dependency chains (Prometheus waits for app services, Grafana waits for Prometheus)

### 4. Kubernetes Monitoring Parity
**New Files:**
- `k8s/monitoring-alertmanager.yml`: Alertmanager deployment + service + config
- `k8s/monitoring-prometheus.yml`: Prometheus deployment + service + config + rules

Both manifests include:
- ConfigMaps with inline configuration
- Proper K8s service DNS names for scrape targets
- Health checks
- Minimal viable alert rules (Layer3Down, Layer5Down, HighErrorRateLayer2)

### 5. CI Dry-Run Validation
**File:** `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`

Added `k8s-dry-run` job that:
- Creates a Kind cluster
- Runs server-side dry-run validation on all core manifests
- Runs server-side dry-run validation on monitoring manifests
- Fails PR if manifests are invalid

### 6. Documentation Updates
**File:** `k8s/README.md`

Added:
- Monitoring deployment step in deployment order
- Runtime verification playbook with `kubectl port-forward` and curl commands
- Commands for checking targets, rules, alerts, and Alertmanager smoke test

### 7. Runtime Validation Script
**New File:** `scripts/monitoring-validation.sh`

Bash script for manual runtime validation including:
- Prometheus target health check
- Rules load status
- Active alerts count
- Alertmanager status
- Alert pipeline smoke test

## Validation Results

### Static Validation: PASSED
- Docker Compose config syntax: Valid (exit code 0)
- K8s monitoring-alertmanager.yml: Valid multi-doc YAML (3 documents)
- K8s monitoring-prometheus.yml: Valid multi-doc YAML (3 documents)
- Prometheus config syntax: Valid (no parse errors)
- Alertmanager config syntax: Valid

### Runtime Validation: PENDING
**Reason:** Docker Desktop not running (documented in DEPLOYMENT_REALITY_REPORT.md)

**To complete runtime validation:**
1. Start Docker Desktop
2. Run: `cd value-fabric && docker-compose up -d`
3. Wait for services to stabilize (~60 seconds)
4. Run: `bash scripts/monitoring-validation.sh`
5. Or manually verify:
   - Prometheus targets: http://localhost:9090/targets
   - Prometheus rules: http://localhost:9090/rules
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - Alertmanager: http://localhost:9093

## Files Modified/Created

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml` | Modified | Fixed scrape target hostnames |
| `monitoring/alerting/alertmanager.yml` | Created | Alertmanager configuration |
| `value-fabric/docker-compose.yml` | Modified | Added prometheus, alertmanager, grafana services |
| `k8s/monitoring-alertmanager.yml` | Created | K8s Alertmanager manifest |
| `k8s/monitoring-prometheus.yml` | Created | K8s Prometheus manifest |
| `k8s/README.md` | Modified | Added monitoring deployment & verification docs |
| `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` | Modified | Added K8s dry-run validation job |
| `scripts/monitoring-validation.sh` | Created | Runtime validation script |

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Compose | K8s | Status |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|
| Prometheus targets match service names | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| Alertmanager wired end-to-end | ✅ | ✅ | Complete |
| Grafana auto-provisioning | ✅ | N/A | Complete |
| Rules load without errors | ⏳ (needs runtime) | ⏳ (needs cluster) | Pending runtime |
| Smoke test alert pipeline | ⏳ (needs runtime) | ⏳ (needs cluster) | Pending runtime |
| CI dry-run validation | N/A | ✅ | Complete |
| Runtime playbook documented | N/A | ✅ | Complete |

## Next Steps (Task 47)

1. **Runtime validation** (requires Docker Desktop running):
   - Run `scripts/monitoring-validation.sh`
   - Verify all targets healthy in Prometheus
   - Verify rules load without errors
   - Verify alert pipeline accepts test alert

2. **Kubernetes runtime validation** (requires K8s cluster):
   - Deploy manifests to cluster
   - Run K8s README verification playbook
   - Confirm service discovery working

## Notes

- The monitoring stack is configured with minimal alert rules. Production deployments should customize:
  - Alert thresholds in `monitoring/alerting/rules.yml`
  - Notification receivers in `monitoring/alerting/alertmanager.yml`
  - Grafana dashboards for specific use cases
- Layer 1 metrics path (`/api/v1/ingestion/metrics`) confirmed from source code at `layer1-ingestion/src/api/main.py:1722`
- All other layers use standard `/metrics` path
