## Detailed File Assessments

### Layer 4 - Agents

#### test_health_tracker.py

**Overview**:
- Test count: 21
- Lines: 318
- Fixtures: tracker (async), badge_collector, status_collector

**Principle Scores**:
| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Behavior-Focused | 5 | Tests health tracking behavior, not internals |
| Clear/Readable | 5 | Clear AAA structure, good naming |
| Focused | 4 | Most tests single-purpose; some slight over-testing |
| Deterministic | 4 | Uses asyncio.sleep(0.1) in auto-hide test (minor flakiness risk) |
| Isolated | 5 | Proper fixtures with cleanup |
| Meaningful | 5 | Covers badges, callbacks, status transitions |
| Maintainable | 4 | Minor implementation coupling (accesses _badges, _auto_hide_tasks) |
| **Total** | **32/35** | Excellent |

**Issues Found**:
- **P2**: `test_auto_hide_badge` accesses private `_badges` and `_auto_hide_tasks`
- **P2**: Uses real `asyncio.sleep(0.1)` instead of mocking time

**Recommended Action**: Leave as-is; P2 issues are minor

---

#### test_checkpoint_resume.py

**Overview**:
- Test count: 12+
- Lines: 496
- Fixtures: mock_checkpoint_saver, mock_tool_registry, orchestrator_with_checkpoint

**Principle Scores**:
| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Behavior-Focused | 5 | Tests pause/resume lifecycle behavior |
| Clear/Readable | 4 | Good structure; some tests are long with setup |
| Focused | 4 | Tests well-focused; some have multiple setup phases |
| Deterministic | 5 | Proper mocking, no timing issues |
| Isolated | 5 | Good fixtures, proper cleanup |
| Meaningful | 5 | Covers critical checkpoint/resume paths |
| Maintainable | 4 | Some implementation coupling with MockCheckpointSaver |
| **Total** | **32/35** | Excellent |

**Issues Found**:
- **P2**: Some tests quite long (>50 lines) with complex setup
- **P2**: MockCheckpointSaver exposes internal storage via `storage` attribute

**Recommended Action**: Leave as-is

---

### Layer 3 - Knowledge

#### test_e2e_pipeline.py

**Overview**:
- Test type: Integration/E2E
- Lines: 787
- Uses testcontainers for Neo4j

**Principle Scores**:
| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Behavior-Focused | 5 | Tests full pipeline behavior |
| Clear/Readable | 4 | Good docstring; fixtures are complex |
| Focused | 3 | E2E tests multiple things (intentional for integration) |
| Deterministic | 3 | Docker-dependent, has retry logic for container startup |
| Isolated | 4 | Module-level container, not test-level isolation |
| Meaningful | 5 | Critical E2E coverage |
| Maintainable | 3 | Heavy fixture dependency, Docker required |
| **Total** | **27/35** | Good (acceptable for E2E) |

**Issues Found**:
- **P1**: Requires Docker running - may fail in some CI environments
- **P1**: Uses hardcoded retries with sleep for container startup (lines 82-95)
- **P2**: Heavy fixture dependencies (neo4j_container, neo4j_driver, settings, etc.)

**Recommended Action**: 
- Add `@pytest.mark.integration` marker explicitly
- Consider using `pytest-docker` or testcontainers' built-in wait strategies
- Document Docker requirement clearly

---

### Layer 2 - Extraction

#### test_extraction.py

**Overview**:
- Test type: Unit
- Lines: 580
- Tests ontology models

**Principle Scores**:
| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Behavior-Focused | 4 | Tests model validation, some implementation details |
| Clear/Readable | 4 | Good naming, clear assertions |
| Focused | 4 | Each test focuses on one model type |
| Deterministic | 5 | No timing, pure validation tests |
| Isolated | 5 | No shared state |
| Meaningful | 4 | Good coverage; some tests just check UUID length |
| Maintainable | 4 | Tests validation rules, may need updates if rules change |
| **Total** | **30/35** | Good |

**Issues Found**:
- **P2**: `test_capability_creation` asserts UUID length (line 38) - tests implementation detail
- **P2**: Tests comment about "overly strict validation" suggests test workaround

**Recommended Action**: Leave as-is; validation tests are inherently coupled to validation rules

---

### Frontend - Unit Tests

#### useValuePacks.test.tsx

**Overview**:
- Framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Lines: 155
- Tests: 5 test cases

**Principle Scores**:
| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Behavior-Focused | 5 | Tests hook behavior, not implementation |
| Clear/Readable | 5 | Good describe/it structure |
| Focused | 5 | Each test has single responsibility |
| Deterministic | 4 | Uses waitFor with timeout (10s) - slightly slow |
| Isolated | 5 | Mocks cleared in beforeEach |
| Meaningful | 5 | Covers success, error, filters, null params |
| Maintainable | 5 | Good factory helper (createMockResponse) |
| **Total** | **34/35** | Excellent |

**Issues Found**:
- **P2**: Error test has 15s timeout - slower than necessary

**Recommended Action**: Already has good `createMockResponse` helper (previously refined)

---

### Cross-layer Tests

#### test_security_headers.py

**Overview**:
- Framework: pytest + FastAPI TestClient
- Lines: 94
- Tests: 6 test cases

**Principle Scores**:
| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Behavior-Focused | 5 | Tests security header behavior |
| Clear/Readable | 5 | Clear assertions, good constants |
| Focused | 5 | Each test checks specific header set |
| Deterministic | 5 | No timing, deterministic assertions |
| Isolated | 5 | Uses client fixture |
| Meaningful | 5 | Critical security coverage |
| Maintainable | 5 | Headers defined as constants, easy to update |
| **Total** | **35/35** | Excellent |

**Issues Found**: None

**Recommended Action**: Model for other security tests

---

#### test_l2_l3_contract.py

**Overview**:
- Framework: pytest (contract tests)
- Lines: 95
- Tests: 4 contract validation tests

**Principle Scores**:
| Principle | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Behavior-Focused | 5 | Tests contract alignment |
| Clear/Readable | 5 | Clear test names, good helpers |
| Focused | 5 | Each test validates specific contract aspect |
| Deterministic | 5 | Static analysis, no external deps |
| Isolated | 5 | No shared state |
| Meaningful | 5 | Critical for API contract integrity |
| Maintainable | 4 | AST parsing may break with code changes |
| **Total** | **34/35** | Excellent |

**Issues Found**:
- **P2**: AST parsing for endpoint extraction (line 31-46) is fragile to code structure changes

**Recommended Action**: Leave as-is; AST parsing is acceptable for contract tests

## Issues Summary

### By Severity

**P0 - Critical (0 issues)**:
- None found

**P1 - Material (8 issues)**:
1. `test_e2e_pipeline.py`: Docker dependency may cause CI failures
2. `test_e2e_pipeline.py`: Hardcoded retry logic with sleep for container startup
3. `test_neo4j_integration.py`: Likely similar Docker dependency (not reviewed but inferred)
4. `test_checkpoint_resume.py`: Some tests are quite long (>50 lines)
5. `test_health_tracker.py`: Minor implementation coupling
6. `test_extraction.py`: Tests UUID length (implementation detail)
7. `useValuePacks.test.tsx`: 15s timeout slower than necessary
8. General: Some async tests may need `@pytest.mark.asyncio` markers verified

**P2 - Improvement (15 issues)**:
1. Multiple tests: Could extract more factory helpers
2. Several test files: Some tests could be split for even more focus
3. E2E tests: Consider adding explicit markers
4. Some fixtures: Could be moved to conftest.py for reuse
5. Mock configurations: Some duplication across test files

### By Type

| Issue Type | Count | Severity |
|------------|-------|----------|
| docker_dependency | 2 | P1 |
| timing_flakiness | 1 | P1 |

## Prioritized Rewrite Queue

### P1 - Material Priority

1. [x] `test_e2e_pipeline.py` - Added `@pytest.mark.integration`, replaced hardcoded retry loop with `wait_for_logs()` strategy ✓
2. [x] `test_neo4j_integration.py` - Added explicit Docker requirement documentation with pytest.ini marker configuration ✓
3. [x] `test_checkpoint_resume.py` - Extracted setup to shared fixtures in conftest.py, reduced test length from ~496 to ~310 lines ✓
4. [x] `useValuePacks.test.tsx` - Reduced timeout from 15s to 10s, using `createWrapperWithRetry(false)` for faster error testing ✓ 

### P2 - Improvement Priority

1. [ ] Extract common mock factories to shared test utilities
2. [ ] Add `@pytest.mark.asyncio` markers where missing
3. [ ] Move reusable fixtures to conftest.py files
4. [ ] Consider splitting long tests in `test_e2e_pipeline.py`

## Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage Requirements
- Python layers: 80% minimum (enforced in CI)
- Frontend: Not explicitly enforced, but v8 coverage tracked

### Gaps Identified
1. Layer 5 (Ground Truth): Test files present but not fully reviewed
2. Layer 6 (Benchmarks): Unknown test coverage
3. SDK tests: Not yet mapped
4. Error handling paths: Some tests cover errors, but edge cases may be missing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ No P0 issues - no immediate blockers
2. Add explicit markers to E2E tests for selective running
3. Review Docker-dependent tests for CI reliability

### Short-term Actions (This Sprint)
1. Refactor `test_e2e_pipeline.py` container wait strategy
2. Create shared fixture modules for common setups
3. Reduce slow test timeouts where possible

### Long-term Actions
1. Consider test parallelization for faster CI
2. Add property-based testing for complex validation logic
3. Expand contract tests to cover more layer interactions
