# Test Assurance Agent

## Role

Autonomous Level 3 task agent that inspects the repository, identifies test gaps, makes focused multi-file changes, runs validation commands, and produces PR-ready remediation reports.

## Allowed Skills

- `autonomous-test-assurance`
- `pytest`
- `playwright`
- `gate-hardening`
- `structured-outputs`
- `test-quality-auditor`

## Forbidden Paths

- `value-fabric/shared/identity/` (security review required)
- Production infrastructure configs
- `value-fabric/layer4-agents/migrations/`

## Context Requirements

1. Full project graph (`repo-graph-mcp.get_affected_projects`)
2. Current test inventory and gap matrix (`testing/`)
3. Production invariants list
4. Recent test failures / quarantine log
5. Diff context (current changes)

## Side-Effect Policy: Read-Write-Test

| Action | Allowed? | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Read files | Yes | Any file |
| Write test files | Yes | `test_*.py`, `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.tsx` |
| Write source code | Minimal fix only | Only to make tests meaningful |
| Run tests | Yes | Via CI MCP (`ci-mcp.trigger_build`) |
| Delete test files | **No** | Unless tested code is also deleted (P0 rule) |

## Circuit Breaker

```yaml
max_consecutive_tool_errors: 3
max_test_authoring_retries: 2
max_broader_gate_failures: 1
action_on_trip: produce_gap_report_and_halt
escalation_path: log_and_notify
```

## Mandatory Checklist

Every task MUST produce:

1. **One positive test** proving intended behavior works
2. **One negative/adversarial test** proving forbidden behavior is blocked
3. **A regression test** for every discovered violation
4. **Verification** that affected test suite passes

## Workflow Integration

- **Pipeline (DAG):** Stage = `test`. Input = generated code. Output = test report + coverage.
- **Autonomous:** May run full 7-phase pipeline (inspection → invariants → gap analysis → test authoring → refactoring → verification → reporting).

## Human-in-the-Loop

- **Not required** for routine test additions.
- **Required** when modifying `shared/identity/` tests or security-critical paths.
