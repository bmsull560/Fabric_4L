# Pre-Production Audit Skill

This skill enables systematic pre-production auditing of enterprise agentic SaaS platforms, with focus on the Value Fabric multi-layer architecture.

## Audit Activation Criteria

Activate this skill when:
- Preparing for production deployment
- After major architectural changes (new layers, API changes, infrastructure updates)
- Pre-release candidate validation
- Compliance requirement triggers (SOC 2, GDPR audits)
- Security incident follow-up requiring full assessment
- Quarterly production readiness reviews

## Multi-Pass Analysis Framework

Execute audits in 5 sequential passes:

**Pass 1: Discovery**
- Map codebase structure across all layers
- Identify configuration files (k8s, Terraform, Docker)
- Catalog API contracts and OpenAPI specs
- Locate security-critical files (auth, secrets handling)

**Pass 2: Surface Analysis**
- Run automated scanners (security, dependencies, secrets)
- Identify obvious code smells and anti-patterns
- Flag TODO/FIXME/placeholder patterns
- Detect mock data vs real implementations

**Pass 3: Deep Analysis**
- Trace data flows through application layers
- Verify API contract alignment (frontend ↔ backend)
- Audit authentication/authorization flows end-to-end
- Review database query patterns and N+1 risks

**Pass 4: Cross-Reference**
- Check OpenAPI specs vs implementation
- Verify cross-layer data flow contracts (L2→L3→L4)
- Validate environment variable consistency
- Confirm monitoring coverage matches architecture

**Pass 5: Risk Assessment**
- Score findings by severity and impact
- Prioritize by compliance requirements
- Map to remediation timeline
- Generate executive summary

## Tier 1: Critical Audit Areas

### 1. Code Analysis & Review

**Static Code Analysis:**
```bash
# Run security-focused static analysis
semgrep --config=auto --severity=ERROR .
ruff check services/ --select=E,W,F,UP,B,C4,SIM
mypy services/ --ignore-missing-imports
```

**Key Checks:**
- Security vulnerabilities (injection risks, path traversal)
- Code smells and anti-patterns
- Type safety (TypeScript strict mode, Python type hints)
- Dead code detection (unused exports, unreachable code)
- TODO/FIXME/placeholder patterns requiring resolution before prod

**Multi-Language Focus:**
- **TypeScript/React**: Audit hooks, component architecture, state management
- **Python**: Audit API endpoints, business logic, async patterns
- **SQL**: Detect N+1 queries, missing indexes, injection risks

**Dependency Analysis:**
```bash
# JavaScript dependencies
npm audit --audit-level=high
pnpm audit --audit-level high

# Python dependencies
pip-audit --desc --format=markdown
safety check

# Container images
trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL <image:tag>
```

**Value Fabric Specific:**
- Verify layer isolation (L1-L6 boundaries)
- Check cross-layer imports follow architecture rules
- Validate shared/ module usage across layers

### 2. Security Assessment

**OWASP Top 10 Coverage:**
- A01: Broken Access Control → Audit RouteGuard, RBAC implementation
- A02: Cryptographic Failures → Verify encryption, hashing, key management
- A03: Injection → SQL injection via SQLAlchemy, XSS via React escaping
- A04: Insecure Design → Multi-tenant isolation, secrets management
- A05: Security Misconfiguration → Default configs, error handling
- A07: Auth Failures → JWT/OAuth implementation, session management

**Authentication/Authorization Audit:**
```python
# Check for in layer4-agents/src/
- OIDC/OAuth flow implementation (tenants/api/routes/oidc.py)
- JWT validation and token refresh
- RBAC permission checks on all admin routes
- RouteGuard fail-open scenarios (frontend)
```

**Secrets Management:**
- Scan for hardcoded secrets: `gitleaks detect --source . -v`
- Verify `.env.example` completeness
- Check Kubernetes secret references (not values in Git)
- Validate Infisical or vault integration

**Container Security:**
```bash
# Dockerfile audit
trivy config k8s/
checkov --file k8s/
```

**Network Security:**
- Review k8s NetworkPolicies
- Verify ingress/egress rules
- Check TLS termination configuration

### 3. Enterprise SaaS Architecture

- Check tenant_id filtering on all queries
- Validate cross-tenant access prevention
- Review tenant-aware caching strategies

**API Design Review:**
- REST contract consistency across all layers
- OpenAPI spec accuracy vs implementation
- API versioning strategy (v1 prefix verification)
- Error response format standardization

**Service Boundaries:**
- Clear separation between L1-L6 responsibilities
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Event-driven architecture implementation (if present)
- Message queue configuration and durability

**Scalability Assessment:**
- Stateless service design
- Horizontal scaling readiness (k8s HPA)
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategy effectiveness

### 4. Compliance & Governance

**SOC 2 Type II Controls:**
| Control | Implementation Evidence | Status |
|---------|------------------------|--------|
| Access Control | RBAC in identity/, OIDC routes | Check |
| Change Management | Git history, PR reviews | Check |
| System Monitoring | Prometheus metrics, alerts | Check |
| Data Backup | Database backup procedures | Check |

**GDPR Requirements:**
- Data classification (PII handling in services/)
- Consent mechanism implementation
- Data deletion capabilities (right to erasure)
- Cross-border data transfer safeguards

**Audit Logging:**
```python
# Verify in shared/audit/
- All authentication events logged
- Data modification audit trails
- Administrative action logging
- Log retention policy compliance
```

**Data Retention:**
