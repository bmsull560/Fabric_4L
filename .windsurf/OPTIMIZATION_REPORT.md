# .windsurf Optimization Report

**Generated:** 2026-05-04
**Auditor:** Cascade AI Assistant
**Scope:** Rules, Workflows, Skills
**Target Audience:** Fellow Architect & AI Developer

---

## Executive Summary

The `.windsurf/` directory is well-structured with strong architectural foundations. However, several optimization opportunities exist to improve maintainability, consistency, and discoverability for AI developers working with this system.

**Key Findings:**

- **Rules:** 8 files, mostly well-structured with 2 critical path errors identified in RULE_REVIEW.md
- **Workflows:** 27 files, good coverage but inconsistent frontmatter and some duplication
- **Skills:** 60 skill definitions, strong schema but inconsistent frontmatter compliance
- **Overall:** Strong foundation, needs standardization and cross-referencing

---

## Priority 1: Critical Rule Fixes

### 1.1 Path Prefix Errors (RULE_REVIEW.md Lines 25-36)

**Issue:** 6 rules use `layer*/**/*.py` globs that will never match because layers live at `value-fabric/layer*/`.

**Affected Rules:**

- `HC-003`: `layer4-agents/migrations/*.py` → `value-fabric/layer4-agents/migrations/*.py`
- `DR-002`: `layer*/**/*.py` → `value-fabric/layer*/**/*.py` ✅ Already correct
- `SR-001`: `layer*/**/*.py` → `value-fabric/layer*/**/*.py` ✅ Already correct
- `SR-003`: `layer*/src/api/**/*.py` → `value-fabric/layer*/src/api/**/*.py` ✅ Already correct
- `SR-006`: `layer*/src/api/**/*.py` → `value-fabric/layer*/src/api/**/*.py` ✅ Already correct

**Status:** Most rules already have correct `value-fabric/` prefix. Verify `HC-003` is correct.

### 1.2 SR-003 Auth Pattern (RULE_REVIEW.md Lines 40-54)

**Issue:** Rule looks for `@require_auth` decorator, but codebase uses FastAPI dependency injection.

**Current Implementation:** `safety-rules.yaml` SR-003 uses `missing_dependency: require_authenticated` ✅ Already correct

**Status:** Already fixed in current implementation.

### 1.3 style-rules.yaml ESLint Path (RULE_REVIEW.md Lines 57-64)

**Issue:** Claims config is at `frontend/eslint.config.js` (flat config), actual is `frontend/.eslintrc.js` (legacy).

**Current Implementation:** `style-rules.yaml` line 19 uses `frontend/.eslintrc.js` ✅ Already correct

**Status:** Already fixed in current implementation.

---

## Priority 2: Missing Rules (RULE_REVIEW.md Lines 99-107)

### 2.1 DR-005: Root Tests Exemption

**Status:** ✅ Added to `dependency-rules.yaml` line 49

### 2.2 ST-004: No `any` Type in TypeScript

**Status:** ✅ Added to `style-rules.yaml` lines 40-44

### 2.3 ST-005: Tailwind v4 CSS Config

**Status:** ✅ Already documented in `style-rules.yaml` lines 35-38

### 2.4 SR-007 & SR-008: SOQL & Dev Auth Bypass

**Status:** ✅ Already added to `safety-rules.yaml` lines 114-159

---

## Priority 3: Workflow Optimizations

### 3.1 Inconsistent Frontmatter

**Issue:** Workflows have inconsistent frontmatter formats. Some have description, some don't, some have tags.

**Recommendation:** Standardize all workflow frontmatter to include:

```yaml
---
description: [one-line purpose]
tags: [category, keywords]  # optional
---
```

**Files to Update:**

- `autonomous-test-assurance-agent.md` ✅ Has description
- `contract-enforcement-auditor.md` ✅ Has description
- `dead-code-sweeper.md` ✅ Has description
- `deprecation-migrator.md` ✅ Has description
- `dil-hook-scaffolder.md` ✅ Has description
- `facade-page-connector.md` ✅ Has description
- `tool-contract-sync.md` ✅ Has description
- `code-boundary-enforcement.md` ✅ Has description
- `fabric_ui_drift_agent.md` ✅ Has description + tags
- `test-quality-remediation.md` ✅ Has description
- `launch-readiness-assessment.md` ✅ Has description + tags
- `refinement.md` ✅ Has description
- `react_component_design.md` ✅ Has description

**Action:** All workflows now have descriptions. Typo fixed: `cleanuo-docs.md` → `cleanup-docs.md`.

### 3.2 Workflow-Skill Duplication

**Issue:** Some workflows duplicate content with corresponding skills:

- `contract-enforcement-auditor.md` (workflow) vs `contract-enforcement-auditor/SKILL.md` (skill)
- `dead-code-sweeper.md` (workflow) vs `dead-code-sweeper/SKILL.md` (skill)
- `deprecation-migrator.md` (workflow) vs `deprecation-migrator/SKILL.md` (skill)

**Recommendation:** Clarify distinction:

- **Workflows:** High-level orchestration patterns for human-driven processes
- **Skills:** Reusable capability modules that agents can invoke programmatically

**Action:** Add cross-references in each file pointing to the related workflow/skill.

### 3.3 Missing Cross-References

**Issue:** Related workflows don't reference each other, making discovery difficult.

**Recommendation:** Add "Related Workflows" section to each workflow:

```markdown
## Related Workflows
- `/contract-enforcement-auditor` — Audit contract compliance
- `/deprecation-migrator` — Fix anti-pattern instances
- `/tool-contract-sync` — Sync tools with skill definitions
```

### 3.4 Empty File

**Issue:** `workflows/frontend.md` is empty (0 bytes).

**Action:** Either remove or add content if needed.

---

## Priority 4: Skill Optimizations

### 4.1 Frontmatter Compliance with SKILL_SCHEMA.md

**Schema Requirements:**

```yaml
---
skill_id: unique-kebab-case-id
name: human-readable-name
version: 1.0.0
description: One-line purpose
side_effects: none | read | write | network | exec
timeout_ms: 30000
required_context: [...]
allowed_agents: [...]
---
```

**Audit Results:**

- `contract-enforcement-auditor/SKILL.md` ❌ Missing full frontmatter (only name + description)
- `deprecation-migrator/SKILL.md` ❌ Missing full frontmatter (only name + description)
- `dead-code-sweeper/SKILL.md` ❌ Missing full frontmatter (only name + description)

**Action:** Update these skill files to include full frontmatter per SKILL_SCHEMA.md.

### 4.2 Missing schema.json Files

**Issue:** Most skills lack optional `schema.json` files for explicit input/output schemas.

**Recommendation:** Add schema.json for high-value skills that have complex inputs/outputs:

- `contract-enforcement-auditor`
- `dead-code-sweeper`
- `deprecation-migrator`
- `dil-hook-scaffolder`
- `facade-page-connector`

### 4.3 Skill Index

**Issue:** No index/overview of all 60 skills.

**Action:** Create `skills/INDEX.md` listing all skills with:

- Skill name
- Brief description
- When to use
- Related workflows

---

## Priority 5: General Optimizations

### 5.1 Cross-References Between Rules, Workflows, Skills

**Issue:** No cross-references between related artifacts.

**Action:** Add "See Also" sections:

- In rules: Reference workflows that enforce them
- In workflows: Reference skills they use
- In skills: Reference workflows that invoke them

### 5.2 Documentation Consolidation

**Issue:** `rules/rules.md` and `rules/rules_ops.md` are marked as "legacy" but still valuable.

**Action:** Either:

1. Mark clearly as reference material with last review date
2. Consolidate into a single comprehensive rules document
3. Archive if truly obsolete

### 5.3 Template Usage

**Issue:** Some workflows don't use the available templates (`_templates/`).

**Action:** Review workflows that could benefit from template patterns:

- `manager-worker.md` template for parallel refactoring
- `pipeline-dag.md` template for multi-stage processes
- `human-in-the-loop.md` template for high-risk changes

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1 hour)

2. ✅ Add ST-004 to `style-rules.yaml`
3. Verify all path prefixes are correct in YAML rules
4. Fix typo: `cleanuo-docs.md` → `cleanup-docs.md`

### Phase 2: Standardization (2 hours)

1. Add missing descriptions to workflow frontmatter
2. Update skill frontmatter to match SKILL_SCHEMA.md
3. Add cross-references between related workflows and skills

### Phase 3: Discovery Improvements (2 hours)

1. Create `skills/INDEX.md` skill catalog
2. Create `workflows/INDEX.md` workflow catalog
3. Add "Related Workflows" sections to workflows
4. Add "Related Skills" sections to workflows

### Phase 4: Documentation Cleanup (1 hour)

1. Review and consolidate legacy rules documentation
2. Remove or populate `workflows/frontend.md`

## Notes for Peer Colleague

1. **The foundation is strong** - The architecture is well-designed with clear separation between rules, workflows, and skills.

2. **Focus on consistency** - The biggest wins come from standardizing frontmatter and adding cross-references.

3. **Skills are the building blocks** - Invest time in skill schema compliance; this pays dividends in agent reliability.

4. **Workflows orchestrate humans** - Keep workflows focused on human-driven processes, not programmatic agent tasks.

5. **Rules are guardrails** - The YAML rule engine is production-grade; ensure it stays in sync with codebase changes.
