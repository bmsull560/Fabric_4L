# Frontend Workflow Coverage Matrix

**Owner:** Frontend Platform  
**Last updated:** May 5, 2026  
**Purpose:** This matrix is the source of truth for deciding whether user-facing frontend workflows are functioning as expected. It complements Playwright, Vitest, contract tests, accessibility scans, and bundle checks by making the expected workflow proof explicit.

## Release Gate Policy

A workflow is considered release-significant when it appears in the **P0** or **P1** tables below. Release-significant workflow tests must fail closed: they must not use `test.skip`, `test.fixme`, backend skip valves, or placeholder assertions. A green workflow result means the tested user can reach the intended business state, the route persists the expected context across navigation or reload, invalid actions are blocked before mutation, and API failures expose recoverable UI states.

| Gate | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Type safety | `pnpm run check` passes. |
| Contract safety | `pnpm run test:contracts` passes and schema drift checks validate canonical OpenAPI fixtures. |
| P0 workflow safety | `pnpm run test:e2e:validation:p0` and `pnpm run test:e2e:guard` pass in CI-capable environments. |
| Broad workflow safety | `pnpm run test:e2e:validation` passes before release candidate sign-off. |
| Accessibility and resilience | P0 flows include keyboard, error, and role-state assertions through focused E2E or component tests. |
| Build and bundle confidence | `pnpm run build` and `pnpm run test:bundle-budget` pass. |
| Master workflow traceability | `docs/validation/product_workflow_validation_inventory.md` remains aligned to P0/P1 evidence owners in this matrix. |

## Alignment With Comprehensive Workflow Inventory

The repository now treats the comprehensive validation inventory as the product-level backlog and this frontend matrix as the browser-test execution map. The inventory defines six validation suites: **Golden Path E2E**, **Layer-by-Layer Validation**, **Security/Tenant Isolation**, **Agent Grounding and Governance**, **Calculation and Evidence Integrity**, and **Operational Resilience**. The P0 rows below cover the highest production-readiness workflows, while the P1 rows provide route and journey owners for the broader uploaded scope.

| Uploaded inventory priority | Frontend gate mapping |
|---|---|
| Account setup → ingestion → extraction → graph → hypotheses → value tree → calculator → business case | `P0-ACCOUNT-LIFECYCLE`, `P0-LAYER-VALIDATION`, `P0-CALC-EVIDENCE` |
| Evidence-to-claim traceability from final output back to raw source | `P0-CALC-EVIDENCE`, `P0-APPROVAL-EXPORT`, `P0-AGENT-GOVERNANCE` |
| Tenant isolation across every layer | `P0-AGENT-GOVERNANCE`, `P1-SETTINGS`, `P1-SEARCH-SECURITY` |
| Agent refusal and grounding under adversarial input | `P0-AGENT-GOVERNANCE`, `P1-ADVERSARIAL` |
| Formula correctness and scenario reproducibility | `P0-CALC-EVIDENCE`, `P1-CONTEXT` |
| Review/approval gates before export or CRM push | `P0-APPROVAL-EXPORT`, `P1-INTEGRATIONS` |
| Recovery from failed jobs and partial workflows | `P0-LAYER-VALIDATION`, `P1-RESILIENCE` |

## P0 Workflows

## P2 Watchlist

| Route or workflow | Required action |
|---|---|
| `/formula-builder` | Ensure the standalone route has explicit component or E2E coverage beyond broad navigation. |
| `/graph-explorer` | Ensure the standalone graph route has assertions for empty, success, and error states. |
| `/signup` and `/login/callback` | Keep auth lifecycle tests aligned with the deployed identity provider behavior. |
| `/dev/integration` | Keep development-only route gated and excluded from production-sensitive navigation. |
| Business-case document export variants | Keep PDF, DOCX, and slide export parity aligned with approval gates and evidence traceability. |
| Versioning and immutable audit reports | Expand frontend evidence once immutable-record views are productized. |
| Value realization post-sale measurement | Preserve CSM workflow coverage as realization planning moves beyond mocks. |

## Sprint Acceptance Checklist

| Sprint | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|
| Sprint 1 | TypeScript, contract tests, full Vitest, build, and critical E2E guard pass locally. |
| Sprint 2 | Every P0 workflow has an owning test file, route list, persona expectation, resilience proof, and accessibility proof in this matrix. |
| Sprint 3 | Every P1 workflow has a route-family test owner and a documented risk to monitor. |
| Sprint 4 | P0 workflows include persona, accessibility, responsive navigation, and API failure-state coverage expectations. |
| Sprint 5 | Release confidence is automated through `verify:frontend`, workflow-matrix validation, bundle-budget validation, and fail-closed E2E guard checks. |
| Master inventory integration | Every uploaded production-readiness workflow maps to a P0/P1 owner, a P2 watchlist item, or a backend/platform validation matrix before release-candidate sign-off. |
