# Data Intelligence Layer (DIL) — Architecture & API Reference

The Data Intelligence Layer extends the Value Fabric with structured intelligence services that transform raw signals and account data into actionable sales intelligence. It spans Layer 3 (Knowledge Graph) and Layer 4 (Agent Services), providing a unified pipeline from data ingestion through narrative delivery.

## Architecture Overview

The DIL is organized into three functional phases, each building on the previous one to create a complete intelligence pipeline.

| Phase | Name | Services | Layer |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Data Foundation | Product Portfolio, Account Enrichment, Evidence Library | L3 + L4 |
| Phase 2 | Intelligence Processing | Value Hypothesis Engine, Competitive Intel, ROI Calculator | L3 + L4 |
| Phase 3 | Delivery & Orchestration | Narrative Builder, Intelligence Orchestrator | L4 |

## Data Flow

The intelligence pipeline follows a directed flow from raw data to delivered narratives:

```

Signal Detection ──► Product Portfolio (L3) ──► Value Hypotheses (L4)

| 0.40 – 0.59 | Developing |
| 0.60 – 0.79 | Prepared |
| 0.80 – 1.00 | Deal Ready |

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/intelligence/account/{id}/briefing` | GET | Full account briefing |
| `/api/v1/intelligence/account/{id}/deal-readiness` | GET | Deal readiness score |
| `/api/v1/intelligence/pipeline-summary` | GET | Pipeline intelligence |

## Multi-Tenancy

All DIL services enforce tenant isolation. Every Neo4j node includes a `tenant_id` property, and all queries filter by tenant. The tenant context is extracted from the request state (set by authentication middleware) or from the `X-Tenant-ID` header as a fallback.

## Testing

The DIL includes comprehensive unit and integration tests organized by phase:

| Test File | Layer | Phase | Tests |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| `test_dil_phase1.py` | L3 | 1 | Product service, case study service, data models |
| `test_enrichment.py` | L4 | 1 | Enrichment orchestrator, source handlers, route models |
| `test_dil_phase2.py` | L3 | 2 | Competitive intel, ROI calculator, financial math |
| `test_value_hypothesis.py` | L4 | 2 | Hypothesis engine, ranking, CRUD |
| `test_dil_phase3.py` | L4 | 3 | Narrative builder, intelligence orchestrator, cross-service integration |

All tests use mock Neo4j drivers and do not require external services. Run with:

```bash
# L3 tests
cd value-fabric/layer3-knowledge
python3 -m pytest tests/test_dil_phase1.py tests/test_dil_phase2.py --noconftest -v

# L4 tests
cd value-fabric/layer4-agents
python3 -m pytest tests/test_enrichment.py tests/test_value_hypothesis.py tests/test_dil_phase3.py --noconftest -v
```
