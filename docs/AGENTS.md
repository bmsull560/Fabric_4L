# AGENTS.md — Contributor Guide for AI Agents and Developers

This file explains how to work safely and effectively in the Value Fabric repository,
whether you are a human developer or an AI coding agent. Read this before making changes.

## Codex + Windsurf Bridge

This repository also includes a `.windsurf/` runtime workspace with agent rules, skills,
workflows, and memory artifacts. Codex should treat `.windsurf/` as a reference source of
project-specific operating guidance, not as an executable runtime.

When working in this repo:

- Read `.windsurf/README.md` for the runtime layout when the task touches agent behavior.
- Use `.windsurf/AGENTS.md`, `.windsurf/CONTEXT.md`, and `.windsurf/MEMORY.md` as supporting
  guidance for planning, context assembly, and artifact discovery.
- Treat `.windsurf/rules/`, `.windsurf/registry/`, `.windsurf/skills/`, and
  `.windsurf/workflows/` as versioned project documentation unless the user explicitly asks to
  modify them.
- Prefer this root `AGENTS.md` and `packages/platform-contract/CONTRACT.md` when there is any
  conflict with guidance inside `.windsurf/`.
- Never assume `.windsurf/mcp/` manifests are live Codex tools in the current session; use only
  tools actually exposed in the environment.

## Change safety rules

These rules exist because this is a production multi-agent system where behavior
emerges from interactions between agents, tools, and the knowledge graph.

### P0 — Never do these

1. **Do not commit secrets.** No API keys, passwords, or tokens in any file. Use `.env` (gitignored).
2. **Do not modify `value_fabric/shared/identity/` without a security review.** This is the
   cross-layer authentication and authorization library. Bugs here affect every service.
3. **Do not modify `services/layer4-agents/migrations/` by hand.** Use Alembic to generate
   new migration files: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`.
4. **Do not change a tool manifest in `contracts/tool-manifests/` without updating the
   corresponding skill definition in `layer4-agents/skills/`.** Contracts and skills must stay in sync.
5. **Do not remove or weaken existing tests.** If a test is blocking you, understand why before
   touching it. Tests encode behavioral contracts.

### P1 — Be careful with these

- **Provider changes** (`services/layer*/src/ (service code) and/or value_fabric/layer*/ (runtime package code)`) — These affect live data flows. Changing
  extraction logic can alter the shape of the knowledge graph, breaking downstream agents.
- **Ontology changes** (`packs/*/ontology.json`) — Entity type and relationship changes are
  effectively schema migrations for the knowledge graph.
- **Agent/skill definitions** (`layer4-agents/agents/`, `layer4-agents/skills/`) — Prompt changes
  alter agent behavior. Always add or update evals in `tests/evals/` when changing prompts.

## Platform Contract (NEW — read this first)

All cross-layer patterns are governed by the **Platform Contract** in
packages/platform-contract/CONTRACT.md. Before adding any code that touches:

- tenant context propagation
- DB session creation
- middleware / auth flow
- tool invocation boundaries
- agent output shapes
- UI state / routing

Read the contract. The canonical patterns are enforced in CI. Violations block merge.

Key files:
- packages/platform-contract/CONTRACT.md — the contract document
- packages/platform-contract/src/python/canonical/ — reference Python signatures
- packages/platform-contract/src/typescript/ — reference TypeScript types
- docs/platform-contract/DEPRECATION_MAP.md — what not to use and when it becomes an error

## Required verification steps

Before opening a PR, run:

```bash
make verify
```

This runs: conflict-marker scan → lint → type-check → unit tests → contract tests → build.

### Troubleshooting: merge conflict marker failures

If `make verify` fails in `check-conflict-markers`, open the reported `file:line` entries and remove unresolved Git merge markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) by completing or redoing the merge, then rerun `make verify`.

For agent/skill changes, also run:

```bash
make evals
```

This runs the golden-trace evaluation suite in `tests/evals/`.

Individual layer commands:

```bash
make test-layer1    # Layer 1 unit + integration tests
make test-layer2    # Layer 2 unit + integration tests
make test-layer3    # Layer 3 unit + integration tests
make test-layer4    # Layer 4 unit + integration tests
make test-frontend  # Frontend unit + type-check
```

### Layer 5 source-contract gate (required)

Before running Layer 5 tests, run:

```bash
python services/layer5-ground-truth/scripts/check_no_duplicate_modules.py
```

This check fails if the canonical Layer 5 tree contains self-recursive shims, mutates `sys.path`, or if the compatibility tree drifts from thin re-export shims:

- `services/layer5-ground-truth/src/layer5_ground_truth` (canonical source-of-truth)
- `value_fabric/layer5` (compatibility shims only)

If it fails, keep the canonical implementation in `services/layer5-ground-truth/src/layer5_ground_truth` and update `value_fabric/layer5` to thin compatibility shims.

## How to add a new agent skill

1. Create a skill definition in `layer4-agents/skills/<name>.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: What this skill does
   ---
   # My Skill
   ## Parameters
   - `param1`: Type and description (required)
   ## Steps
   1. Step one
   ## Output
   What is returned
   ```

2. Create the corresponding tool manifest in `contracts/tool-manifests/<name>.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
     "name": "my_skill",
     "description": "What this skill does",
     "parameters": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "param1": { "type": "string", "description": "..." }
       },
       "required": ["param1"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. Implement the tool function in `services/layer4-agents/src/tools/`.

4. Register the tool in `services/layer4-agents/src/tools/__init__.py`.

5. Add a golden-trace eval in `tests/evals/skills/test_<name>.py`.

6. Run `make verify && make evals`.

## How to add a new agent

1. Create the agent definition in `layer4-agents/agents/<name>_agent.md` with frontmatter
   listing its allowed skills.
2. Implement the agent in `services/layer4-agents/src/agents/<name>.py`.
3. Register it in the agent router.
4. Add integration tests in `services/layer4-agents/tests/`.
5. Document its purpose and constraints in the definition file.

---

## How to add a new provider

1. Create the provider adapter in the relevant layer's `src/` directory.
2. Accept configuration via environment variables only — never hardcode credentials.
3. Add the new env vars to `.env.example` if using the legacy template path, or to the relevant service-local env template where applicable.
4. Document the provider in `Providers.md`.
5. Write integration tests that can run without the real provider (use mocks/fixtures).

---

## Debugging with traces

Layer 4 emits OpenTelemetry traces for every agent run and tool call.

To inspect traces locally:
```bash
docker compose up -d jaeger
# Open http://localhost:16686
```

To correlate a failed agent run:
1. Find the `trace_id` in the response or agent log output.
2. Search for it in Jaeger or your observability backend.
3. Inspect the tool call sequence and intermediate outputs.

For production traces, see `monitoring/` for Grafana dashboards.

---

## Coding standards

- **Python**: Follow `ruff` rules (configured in each layer's `pyproject.toml`). Type hints required.
- **TypeScript**: Follow ESLint config in `apps/web/`. No `any` unless unavoidable.
- **Tests**: Deterministic unit tests only — no external calls. Use `pytest-mock` or `unittest.mock`.
- **Commits**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:`.
- **Secrets**: Use `.env.example` for templates. Never put real values anywhere tracked by git.

## Runtime request limiting canonical module

- Canonical implementation: `value_fabric/shared/rate_limiting/tenant_rate_limiter.py`.
- Non-canonical adapters (for compatibility only):
  - `value_fabric/shared/identity/rate_limiter.py`
  - `value_fabric/layer3/api/rate_limiter.py`
- Rule: adapter modules must delegate through a narrow interface and must not duplicate
  sliding-window state math or Redis counter semantics.
- Contract: HTTP adapters return `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`,
  `X-RateLimit-Reset`, and `Retry-After` on throttled requests, with body fields
  `detail`, `error`, and `retry_after`.
