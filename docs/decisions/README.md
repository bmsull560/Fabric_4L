# Architecture Decision Records

All significant technical decisions for Value Fabric are documented here using ADRs.

## Process

1. When a significant technical decision is needed, create a new ADR using TEMPLATE.md
2. Number sequentially (0001, 0002, ...)
3. Status starts as "proposed"
4. After implementation and validation, update to "accepted"
5. If superseded, update status to "superseded by ADR-XXXX" and update the superseder
