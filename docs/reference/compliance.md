## Audit Trail Requirements

All audit logs must include:
- Timestamp (UTC, millisecond precision)
- Actor (user ID, service account)
- Action (CRUD operation)
- Resource (tenant, entity, record ID)
- Result (success/failure)
- Source IP
- Trace ID (for request correlation)

Storage:
- Retention: 7 years (compliance requirement)
- Immutability: Append-only, trigger-enforced
- Encryption: Database/storage encryption at rest plus application-layer Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) for Layer 4 stored credentials
- Access: Security team only

## Compliance Monitoring

### Continuous Controls Monitoring

Automated checks run daily:
- Access control violations
- Unpatched critical vulnerabilities
- Failed backups
- Drift from approved configurations
- Expired certificates

### Quarterly Reviews

- Access permissions (user and service accounts)
- Security policy effectiveness
- Incident response readiness
- Third-party risk assessment
