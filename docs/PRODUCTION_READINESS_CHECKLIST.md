# Production Readiness Checklist

> **Purpose:** Pass/fail criteria for production deployments.

## How to Use

Before any production deployment:

1. Run `make verify` — all checks must pass
2. Run `scripts/security/verify-artifact.sh <image>` for every image being deployed
3. Walk through each section below and mark PASS or FAIL
4. **Any FAIL in a P0 category blocks deployment**

## Security

| # | Check | Criteria | Priority | Status |
|---|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| S1 | **Artifact signatures verified** | `cosign verify` passes for all images with correct OIDC identity | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S2 | **SLSA provenance verified** | `cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance` passes for all images | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S3 | **No HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs** | Trivy container scan shows 0 unfixed HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S4 | **No secrets in source** | gitleaks scan passes with 0 findings on full git history | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S5 | **SAST clean** | CodeQL + bandit report 0 MEDIUM+ findings | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S6 | **Dependency audit clean** | pip-audit (HIGH+) and pnpm audit (CRITICAL) pass | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S7 | **Non-root containers** | All 7 images run as non-root user (verified by CI) | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S8 | **Network policies active** | Deny-all default + per-layer allowlists applied | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S9 | **DAST baseline** | OWASP ZAP baseline scan completes against all API surfaces | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| S10 | **SBOMs generated** | Source-level SBOM scan runs on every PR (`source-sbom-pr` job in `security-gates-merged.yml` and `source-sbom-scan` job in `supply-chain.yml`); image-level SBOM and SLSA provenance run at release only (`sbom-scan`/`provenance` jobs in `supply-chain.yml` require pre-built images and trigger on `workflow_call`/`workflow_dispatch` only — not on every PR) | P1 | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| S11 | **Secrets via Vault/Infisical** | No secrets in K8s manifests; all injected via ExternalSecret | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S12 | **JWT signing key rotated** | JWT signing key age < 30 days | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| S13 | **API key rotation** | All API keys age < 90 days | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| S14 | **RBAC middleware active** | `shared/identity/` middleware applied to all API routes | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S15 | **Audit logging active** | Append-only audit log operational with trigger protection | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S16 | **Zero-trust validation** | `scripts/security/zero_trust_checks.sh` passes all 9 checks | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| S17 | **Dependency review on PR** | `actions/dependency-review-action` blocks HIGH+ new deps | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| S18 | **Threat model current** | `docs/security/threat-model.md` updated within last 90 days | P2 | ✅ PASS |

## Reliability

| # | Check | Criteria | Priority | Status |
|---|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| R1 | **Health checks configured** | Every Dockerfile has HEALTHCHECK; K8s has liveness + readiness probes | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| R2 | **Pod Disruption Budgets** | PDB configured for L2, L3, L4, frontend (`minAvailable ≥ 1`) | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| R3 | **Rolling update strategy** | `maxUnavailable: 0` ensures zero-downtime deploys | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| R4 | **Rollback runbook** | `docs/troubleshooting/runbooks/infrastructure/deployment-rollback.md` exists; covers K8s rollback via `kubectl rollout undo`. ArgoCD-based rollback steps are documented but ArgoCD is not operationally installed — those steps cannot be executed until ArgoCD is wired in. DB schema rollback is not covered. | P0 | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| R5 | **DR policy documented** | `docs/reliability/dr-policy.md` exists with RTO/RPO targets | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| R6 | **DR gameday executed** | Region loss + service failover drills documented | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| R7 | **Backup/restore tested** | `make test-backup-drills` passes | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| R8 | **SLO defined** | `docs/slo/performance-slo.v1.json` with latency + error rate targets | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| R9 | **Alerting configured** | Prometheus rules + AlertManager → Slack for all critical alerts | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| R10 | **Incident runbooks** | Runbooks exist for all critical alert types (10+ runbooks) | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| R11 | **Postmortem template** | `docs/operations/postmortem-template.md` exists | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| R12 | **Smoke tests post-deploy** | `smoke-gate.yml` validates core functionality after deployment | P0 | ✅ PASS |

## Scalability

| # | Check | Criteria | Priority | Status |
|---|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| SC1 | **HPA configured** | Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for L2, L4, frontend | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| SC2 | **Resource limits set** | CPU and memory limits defined for all K8s deployments | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| SC3 | **Load tests passing** | k6 critical-path suite meets SLO thresholds | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| SC4 | **Database connection pooling** | Connection limits configured per service | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| SC5 | **Caching strategy** | Redis caching active for hot paths | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| SC6 | **Build parallelization** | Matrix builds for all 7 services | P2 | ✅ PASS |
| SC7 | **Docker layer caching** | BuildKit GHA cache enabled (`type=gha,mode=max`) | P2 | ✅ PASS |
| SC8 | **Rate limiting** | API rate limits configured (1,000 req/min global) | P0 | ✅ PASS |

## Compliance

| # | Check | Criteria | Priority | Status |
|---|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| C1 | **Control matrix current** | `docs/compliance/control-matrix.md` updated, CI-enforced | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| C2 | **Audit log retention** | 7-year retention policy for API access logs | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| C3 | **SBOM retention** | 30-day artifact retention for all SBOMs | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| C4 | **Security evidence bundle** | `release-security-evidence-<sha>` artifact generated per release | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| C5 | **Vulnerability disclosure** | `docs/trust/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure.md` published | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| C6 | **Vendor risk policy** | `docs/trust/vendor-risk-policy.md` exists with assessment criteria | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| C7 | **Data commitments** | `docs/trust/customer-data-commitments.md` published | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| C8 | **NIST SSDF alignment** | All PO/PS/PW/RV practices mapped to controls | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| C9 | **SLSA Level 3** | Provenance attestation workflow exists (`provenance` job in `supply-chain.yml`) but only triggers on `workflow_call`/`workflow_dispatch` — not on every PR build. SLSA Level 3 requires hermetic, non-falsifiable provenance on every build; the current setup does not meet that bar for PR builds. | P0 | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| C10 | **Accessibility** | axe-core critical scan passes for all public pages | P1 | ✅ PASS |

## Security Test Coverage

| # | Check | Criteria | Priority | Status |
|---|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| T1 | **P0 security gates pass** | All 5 P0 test files pass in `critical-gates.yml` on every PR (`p0-auth-boundaries`, `p0-jwt-config`, `p0-cross-tenant-write`, `p0-auth-source`, `p0-rate-limit-safety`) | P0 | ✅ PASS |
| T2 | **P1 security tests present** | All 9 P1 test files exist in `tests/security/` (`test_context_validation.py`, `test_service_account_validation.py`, `test_rbac_expanded.py`, `test_rate_limit_response.py`, `test_rate_limit_window.py`, `test_audit_resilience.py`, `test_auth_logging.py`, `test_dev_bypass.py`, `test_request_tracing.py`) | P1 | ✅ PASS |
| T3 | **Overall assurance score** | `tests/TEST_AUDIT.md` self-reported score is **62%** against a 92% GA target — a 30-point deficit. 12 P0 release-blocking gaps remain open, concentrated in tenant isolation, auth bypass, and RLS enforcement. | P1 | ❌ FAIL — score 62%, target 92% |
| T4 | **No conditional assertions** | No `if response.status_code` patterns in security tests | P2 | ⚠️ PARTIAL — 8 P2 brittle-test issues documented in gap matrix; deferred to follow-up |

## Summary

| Category | Total Checks | P0 Checks | All P0 Pass? |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Security | 18 | 12 | ⚠️ S10 PARTIAL |
| Reliability | 12 | 8 | ⚠️ R4 PARTIAL (ArgoCD not installed) |
| Scalability | 8 | 3 | ✅ |
| Compliance | 10 | 5 | ⚠️ C9 PARTIAL (SLSA not on every PR) |
| Security Test Coverage | 4 | 1 | ✅ T1 PASS |
| **Total** | **52** | **29** | **❌ See R4(P0), C9(P0), T3(P1)** |

---

## Deployment Decision

- **All P0 checks PASS** → ✅ **CLEARED FOR PRODUCTION**
- **Any P0 check FAIL or PARTIAL** → ❌ **DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED** — resolve before proceeding
- **P1/P2 failures** → ⚠️ **DEPLOY WITH TRACKING** — create issue and assign owner

**Current status: ❌ BLOCKED** — R4 (rollback runbook incomplete without ArgoCD) and C9 (SLSA
provenance not generated on every PR build) are P0 partials. Resolve ArgoCD installation and
extend `supply-chain.yml` provenance trigger before clearing for production.
