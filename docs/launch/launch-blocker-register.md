# Launch Blocker Register

This register is the authoritative pre-launch risk ledger for final testing. It does not convert environment-dependent work into a pass condition. Items that require a configured staging or production-like environment remain open until evidence is attached by the responsible owner.

## Current Launch Decision Posture

| Area | Current Position | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Repository-owned launch package | Local validation passed on 2026-05-08 | Required launch-gate documents and local validators ran successfully after Core GA path hardening. |
| Live production readiness | Not yet claimed | SSO, telemetry, billing, rollback, notification, performance, and full E2E validation require a proper launch environment. |
| Go/no-go rule | Evidence-driven | Missing evidence is treated as an explicit launch decision, not as implied readiness. |

## 2026-05-08 Local Hardening Evidence

The Core GA deterministic clickpath `account -> signals -> evidence -> driver -> calculator -> business case` was hardened and validated locally. The repository-owned final-testing gate passed, the Journey 24 launch E2E passed in deterministic CI data mode, the frontend production build passed, and targeted Layer 4 agent/workflow contract and tenant-isolation tests passed.

This evidence does not close environment-dependent P0/P1 items. Live provider, SSO/OIDC, billing, rollback, alert receiver, telemetry dashboard, performance smoke, and staging SLO evidence remain required before Core GA or paid GA approval.

## 2026-05-09/2026-05-10 Backend-Integrated Evidence Accounting

J11 backend-integrated business lifecycle validation passed as a J11-only retained Playwright artifact.

| Evidence | Result | Artifact | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| J11 business lifecycle backend-integrated Playwright run | PASS - 5 tests passed | `artifacts/live-workflow-validation/playwright/j11-junit.xml` | J11 business lifecycle only. |
| Deterministic backend seed validation | PASS - `aggregateStatus=present`, `requiredRowsPresent=true` | `artifacts/live-workflow-validation/seed-report.json` | J11 seed preconditions only. |
| Full J1+J11 backend-integrated Playwright pair | PASS - 20 tests passed | `artifacts/live-workflow-validation/playwright/junit.xml` | Local Docker-backed backend-integrated J1 golden path plus J11 business lifecycle. |
| CI/staging backend-integrated reproducibility package | PASS WITH CLASSIFIED RETRY - accepted by Test owner on 2026-05-11 | GitHub Actions run `25650409895`; artifact bundle `backend-integrated-reproducibility-evidence-25650409895`; release-candidate SHA `cc6376e35b858f3593771eab34dfac5f5af58552` | CI/staging backend-integrated J1+J11 reproducibility evidence only; unrelated environment gates remain unchanged. |

The local Docker-backed backend-integrated J1+J11 evidence line is now closed by the retained `junit.xml` artifact. This does not prove production readiness, paid GA readiness, CI reproducibility, or staging/live provider readiness. P0-001 remains environment-dependent until the release-candidate rehearsal is reproduced in the approved CI/staging or production-like environment with release SHA, logs, and owner sign-off.

The CI/staging backend-integrated reproducibility package for GitHub Actions run `25650409895` is accepted with classified retry noted. This accepts only the retained backend-integrated J1+J11 reproducibility package and does not alter SSO/OIDC, billing, live LLM provider, rollback, telemetry, alert receiver, performance smoke, broad security suite, or Journey SLO evidence requirements.

### P0 Playwright Live E2E Evidence Progress (Staging)

- Launch-scope journey count: **7**
- Live staging evidence attached: **3 of 7**
- Live staging evidence still required: **4 of 7**

Until the remaining four journeys have retained JUnit/trace/video/screenshot artifacts tied to a release-candidate SHA, `P0-001` remains open as `REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT`.

## P0 Launch Blocker

| ID | Item | Owner | Required Evidence | Current Status | Decision Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-001 | Production-like E2E launch rehearsal is partially complete; 4 of 7 P0 Playwright journeys still require staging runs. | Test owner | All 7 launch-scope P0 journeys must include live staging evidence with real login, live backing services, persisted state, logs, and release-candidate SHA. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks launch until all 7 journeys are evidenced or the affected journeys are formally removed from launch scope. |
| P0-002 | Rollback and restore drill requires launch-environment execution. | SRE owner | Redacted rollback transcript, restore proof, data-integrity check, owner approval, and timing notes. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks launch if rollback or restore cannot be executed within the approved recovery target. |
| P0-003 | Enterprise SSO/OIDC provider validation requires configured provider credentials and tenant mapping. | Identity owner | Provider configuration evidence, successful login/logout, failed-login handling, group/role mapping, and redacted audit event. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks enterprise launch if identity validation is incomplete or fails closed incorrectly. |
| P0-004 | Raw secret exposure in launch artifacts or production-readiness config. | Security owner | Automated launch-gate secret hygiene passes and any findings are remediated. | REQUIRED_PASS | Blocks launch immediately if detected. |

## P1 Launch Blocker

| ID | Item | Owner | Required Evidence | Current Status | Decision Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-001 | Notification and alert receiver validation requires provider-level test delivery. | SRE owner | Redacted alert receiver proof, escalation route, notification test payload, and acknowledgement record. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks launch unless an approved monitored workaround is accepted. |
| P1-002 | Telemetry dashboard and alert validation requires live metric/log/trace flow. | Observability owner | Dashboard link, alert rule evidence, threshold rationale, and redacted event/log samples. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks launch if primary incident detection path is not operational. |
| P1-003 | Billing and metering provider validation requires live or provider sandbox integration. | Billing owner | Meter event proof, invoice or usage aggregation sample, idempotency check, and reconciliation owner sign-off. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks paid launch unless billing is removed from launch scope. |
| P1-004 | Performance and reliability smoke test requires production-like capacity assumptions. | Performance owner | Smoke-test command, timing output, error-rate summary, and release-candidate SHA. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks launch if thresholds fail or are not approved by release owner. |
| P1-005 | Dependency automation coverage must remain complete. | Build owner | `python3 scripts/ci/check_dependabot_coverage.py` passes. | REQUIRED_PASS | Blocks final testing if manifests are uncovered without waiver. |
| P1-006 | Full frontend test report artifact retention remains open after local shard-4 isolation. | Frontend owner / CI owner | CI wired in Sprint 1 (2026-05-18): `pr-checks.yml` and `launch-readiness.yml` now upload SHA-stamped `frontend-test-report-${{ github.sha }}.json` artifact with 90-day retention on every push. Evidence will be attached on next CI run against release SHA. | REQUIRED_PASS | CI artifact upload wired. Evidence attached on next qualifying CI run. |
| P1-007 | Broad security suite report is not yet attached from the intended CI profile. | Security owner | CI wired in Sprint 1 (2026-05-18): `security-gate.yml` now runs `pytest tests/security -v --tb=short --junitxml` and uploads SHA-stamped JUnit XML artifact with 90-day retention. Local run: 26/26 tests pass. Evidence will be attached on next CI run against release SHA. | REQUIRED_PASS | CI artifact upload wired. Local suite 26/26 pass. Evidence attached on next qualifying CI run. |
| P1-008 | Journey SLO report is not yet attached. | Test owner / Observability owner | CI wired in Sprint 1 (2026-05-18): `launch-readiness.yml` stage-5 now runs J1+J11 Playwright, collects journey SLO metrics via `collect-journey-slo-metrics.mjs`, uploads SHA-stamped artifact with 90-day retention, then runs `assert-journey-launch-slos.mjs` gate. `nonEmptyRatio` false-pass bug fixed (null instead of 1.0 fallback). Evidence will be attached on next CI run against release SHA. | REQUIRED_PASS | CI artifact upload and gate wired. Evidence attached on next qualifying CI run. |
| P1-009 | Live LLM provider validation is not yet attached. | AI platform owner | Redacted live/provider-sandbox bundle proving grounded citations, fact/assumption labeling, refusal behavior, prompt-injection resistance, cost tracking, and traceability. | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Blocks Core GA if launch scope includes live LLM workflows and evidence is missing. |

## P2 Follow-Up

| ID | Item | Owner | Required Evidence | Current Status | Decision Rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-001 | Long-term CI timing trend storage and dashboarding. | Build owner | Timing artifacts from `scripts/ci/run_timed_ci_checks.py` are retained by CI after workflow wiring. | DEFERRED_TO_MAINTAINER | Does not block launch; workflow wiring requires maintainer permissions. |
| P2-002 | Post-launch compliance evidence package for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 mapping. | Compliance owner | Completed evidence package linking policies, controls, owners, and post-launch audit artifacts. | PLANNED | Does not block initial launch if core security and incident gates pass. |
| P2-003 | SDK and CLI adoption feedback loop. | Developer experience owner | First-user feedback, documented defects, and follow-up prioritization. | PLANNED | Does not block launch if core API and documentation remain available. |

## Waiver Requirements

Any accepted P0 or P1 risk must include the approving owner, expiration date, customer impact statement, rollback plan, monitoring plan, and explicit scope reduction if the missing evidence affects a launch-critical capability. P2 items require owner and target date but do not require executive waiver.

## J1 Deep Secondary-Coverage Exception Process

`J1` backend-integrated remains the canonical P0 gate. `J1` deep is secondary coverage and can be treated as non-blocking only through this explicit artifact process plus code-owner approval.

### Required artifact entry (must be present in this register)

Each non-blocking `J1` deep exception entry must include all fields below:

- failing spec name (`j1-golden-path-deep.spec.ts`)
- exact command (`pnpm --dir apps/web run test:e2e:golden:j1:deep`)
- failure summary
- root cause category
- why non-blocking for production readiness
- risk level
- owner
- target remediation date
- link to issue/PR
- evidence J1 backend-integrated canonical P0 still passes
- evidence J11 parallel regression still passes
- code-owner approval acknowledgment

### Disallowed non-blocking categories

`J1` deep failures are never non-blocking when related to:

- auth bypass
- tenant isolation
- data corruption
- broken canonical route contracts
- production-only dependency failure
- missing backend integration
- security, privacy, or compliance risk

### PR approval rule

Approval authority is repo maintainers/code owners, but approval is invalid unless the PR explicitly references the updated blocker-register entry.


## Evidence Authority and Reports Policy

- Authoritative launch status must be recorded in this register and in `docs/launch/environment-dependent-evidence-matrix.md`.
- `reports/` artifacts are non-authoritative diagnostics by default.
- A `reports/` artifact may be cited as supporting evidence only when it includes explicit gate linkage, UTC timestamp, commit SHA, and command/check provenance.
- Historical failure logs must live under `reports/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<context>/` or be removed.
