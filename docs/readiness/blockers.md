# Launch Blocker Board

_Last updated: 2026-05-18_
_Canonical readiness source: [`docs/readiness/current.md`](current.md) — 97%_

**Definitions:**
- **P0** — Release-blocking. Pilot cannot launch until resolved.
- **P1** — Must fix before external demo or tenant onboarding expansion.
- **P2** — Post-launch hardening. Required before broad GA.

## P0 — Release blockers

| ID | Area | Blocker | Owner | Status | Evidence / Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0-0 | Repo hygiene | ~~Unresolved Git merge conflict markers in 9 Python files~~ | — | ✅ **RESOLVED** | `make check-conflict-markers` passes as of 2026-05-18 |
| P0-1 | Security / RLS | RLS enforcement test regression — `test_remediation_migrations_do_not_reintroduce_null_visibility` fails; NULL tenant_id visibility may have been reintroduced by a newer migration | — | 🔴 Open | `tests/security/test_rls_enforcement.py::TestRLSPolicyStructure::test_remediation_migrations_do_not_reintroduce_null_visibility` |
| P0-2 | Architecture | Architecture conformance suite has 5 failures — blocks `gate-arch` (blocking gate per `.fabric/prod-gates.policy.yaml`) | — | 🔴 Open | `tests/arch/` — D-01 (L3 compat path), D-02 (L5 TruthObject missing tenant_id), D-03 (syntax error in app_monolith), D-11 (L3 shim drift), D-12 (L3 tenant dep validation) |
| P0-3 | Security / Cache | Redis cache tenant isolation gate is false-green — all 14 tests in `test_redis_tenant_isolation.py` fail with `TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'AsyncMock' and 'int'`; invariant is untested in practice | — | 🔴 Open | `tests/cache/test_redis_tenant_isolation.py` — fix: mock `incr` to return `int` |
| P0-4 | Infra / K8s | Staging `kustomization.yaml` still contains placeholder image digests (`sha256:1111...7777`) — digest guard now blocks staging promotion CI | — | 🔴 Open | `k8s/envs/staging/kustomization.yaml`; run `scripts/ci/prepare_kustomize_deploy.sh staging` |

## P1 — Must fix before external demo

| ID | Area | Item | Owner | Status | Evidence / Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-1 | CI / Security | Mandatory security regression CI job (`mandatory-security-regression` in `security-gates.yml`) not yet a required status check in GitHub branch protection | — | 🔴 Open | `fabric_audit/sprint4_launch_decision_package.md`; configure in GitHub branch protection settings |
| P1-2 | Auth | Unauthenticated route outside allowlist: `GET /workflows/{workflow_id}/state/errors` reachable without auth | — | 🔴 Open | `contracts/route-auth-allowlist.yaml` — add auth dependency or explicit allowlist entry with rationale |
| P1-3 | Test infra | Contract test collection errors in 4 L3 files prevent local contract-suite execution (`test_entity_contract.py`, `test_l3_provenance_audit_contract.py`, `test_l3_route_alias_parity.py`, `test_layer3_graph_deprecation_contract.py`) | — | 🔴 Open | Import-time drift between contract test setup and current L3 code paths |
| P1-4 | Test infra | Schemathesis × pytest-xdist incompatibility crashes `tests/contract` run with `WorkerController has no attribute 'workeroutput'` | — | 🔴 Open | Pin schemathesis/xdist versions or run schemathesis tests serially (`-p no:xdist`) |
| P1-5 | Testing | Connection-pooling and ACID property tests absent — required before multi-tenant GA | — | 🔴 Open | `PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_2026-05-05.md` §2.4 |
| P1-6 | Security | P0 security test gaps: GovernanceMiddleware resolution-order adversarial tests, RequestContext immutability, tier-aware isolation, audit event emission completeness | — | 🔴 Open | Carried from 2026-05-05 assessment |

## P2 — Post-launch hardening

| ID | Area | Item | Owner | Status | Evidence / Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-1 | Auth | OAuth authorization flow for CRM integrations | — | 🔴 Open | `PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_2026-05-05.md` §6.3 |
| P2-2 | Infra | Background sync → Celery/Redis queue (currently `asyncio.create_task`) | — | 🔴 Open | Layer 1 Celery wiring gap |
| P2-3 | Testing | Comprehensive E2E coverage for critical flows | — | 🔴 Open | — |
| P2-4 | Data | Dedicated `sync_jobs` history table | — | 🔴 Open | — |
| P2-5 | Observability | Prometheus export for all metrics + full SLO/error-budget monitoring | — | 🔴 Open | `gate-obs` advisory; SLO monitoring is GA blocker |
| P2-6 | Ops | Disaster recovery rehearsal | — | 🔴 Open | — |
| P2-7 | Security | Penetration testing | — | 🔴 Open | — |
| P2-8 | Infra / K8s | K8s image digest pinning + admission-time validation (Kyverno/OPA Gatekeeper) | — | 🔴 Open | Digest guard in CI is a partial mitigation; cluster-side enforcement still needed |
| P2-9 | Contract debt | Canonical contract compliance ~58% (~449 active violations) | — | 🔴 Open | `reports/CONTRACT_AUDIT_REPORT.md`; in-flight migration backlog |
| P2-10 | Frontend | 12 placeholder items blocked on backend endpoints (L2 extraction disabled, L3 entity creation not exposed) | — | 🔴 Open | `reports/FRONTEND_STABILIZATION_REPORT_2026-05-06.md` §1–3 |

## Sprint 0 Closures (2026-05-18)

| Item | Resolution |
|---|---|
| P0-0 Merge conflicts | ✅ Resolved — `make check-conflict-markers` passes |
| Layer 3 `VaultSourceNotSupportedError` not defined | ✅ Fixed — `manager.py` now defines the class and raises it; all 7 vault tests pass |
| Digest guard not wired into CI | ✅ Fixed — `environment-promotion.yml` now blocks staging + prod deploys on placeholder digests |
| `database.py` 501 → 422 + DeprecationWarning | ✅ Already done (pre-Sprint 0) — confirmed by test suite |
| `kustomization.yaml` prod placeholder digests | ✅ Already done (pre-Sprint 0) — confirmed by guard script |
