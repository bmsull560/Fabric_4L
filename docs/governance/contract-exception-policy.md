# Contract Exception Policy

**Status:** Active  
**Effective Date:** 2026-04-28  
**Applies To:** All Fabric 4L canonical contracts per CONTRACT.md

---

## Purpose

This policy defines when and how exceptions to the Fabric 4L canonical contracts may be granted. The goal is to balance:

- **Enforcement:** Contracts must be followed to maintain platform integrity
- **Pragmatism**: Legitimate technical constraints may require temporary exceptions
- **Transparency**: All exceptions are tracked and subject to expiration

---

## Exception Types

### 1. Temporary Exception (TE)

For time-bound situations where migration to the canonical pattern is in progress.

| Field | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Max Duration** | 30 days |
| **Justification** | Migration in progress with documented plan |
| **Approval** | Tech Lead + Architecture Review |
| **Extension** | One 15-day extension max |

### 2. Architectural Exception (AE)

For cases where the canonical pattern genuinely doesn't fit the use case.

| Field | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Max Duration** | 90 days (requires quarterly review) |
| **Justification** | Technical incompatibility documented in ADR |
| **Approval** | Architecture Review Board |
| **Extension** | Requires new ARB review |

### 3. Emergency Exception (EE)

For production incidents requiring immediate mitigation.

| Field | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Max Duration** | 7 days |
| **Justification** | Incident ticket with severity P0/P1 |
| **Approval** | On-call Engineer + post-hoc ARB review |
| **Extension** | Convert to TE within 48 hours |

## Exception Process

### Step 1: Document in Deprecation Register

Add entry to `docs/governance/deprecations.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "DEP-XXX-NNN",
  "pattern": "...",
  "status": "exception",
  "exceptionType": "TE|AE|EE",
  "exception": {
    "ticket": "JIRA-1234",
    "approvedBy": "name@example.com",
    "approvedDate": "2026-04-28",
    "expirationDate": "2026-05-28",
    "justification": "Detailed explanation",
    "mitigation": "How risk is controlled during exception period"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Add Code Annotation

Mark exception sites in code:

```python
# CONTRACT_EXCEPTION: DEP-XXX-NNN
# Expires: 2026-05-28
# Reason: Migration to canonical pattern in progress
# ApprovedBy: name@example.com
# RiskMitigation: Isolated test environment, no production data
def legacy_function(tenant_id: str):  # noqa: DEP-XXX-NNN
    ...
```

### Step 3: CI Validation

CI will:
1. Verify exception ID exists in register
2. Verify expiration date hasn't passed
3. Verify approval chain is complete
4. Fail build if exception expired

---

## Approval Hierarchy

| Exception Type | Required Approvers | Escalation Path |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Temporary (TE) | Tech Lead + 1 Senior Engineer | Architecture Review Board |
| Architectural (AE) | Architecture Review Board (3+ members) | CTO Decision |
| Emergency (EE) | On-call Engineer + Incident Commander | Post-incident ARB review |

---

## What Is Never Exemptible

The following are **never** eligible for exceptions:

### Security Critical
- ✓ Cross-tenant data access risks
- ✓ Raw secrets/credentials in code
- ✓ Unvalidated user input reaching DB queries
- ✓ Authentication bypass patterns

### Contract Critical
- ✓ Tenant context propagation in request handlers
- ✓ Tool boundary violations in agent execution
- ✓ Agent output validation before UI/business logic
- ✓ Inline DB sessions in request handlers

### Compliance Critical
- ✓ Audit logging requirements
- ✓ Data retention policy violations
- ✓ GDPR/privacy data handling
- ✓ Security scan soft-failing in CI

---

## Exception Register

All exceptions are tracked in `docs/governance/deprecations.json` under the `exceptions` array.

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique exception ID (DEP-XXX-NNN) |
| `contract` | Which canonical contract (e.g., "2.1-tenant-context") |
| `exceptionType` | TE, AE, or EE |
| `approvedBy` | Email of approver |
| `approvedDate` | ISO 8601 date |
| `expirationDate` | Hard expiration date |
| `justification` | Detailed technical rationale |
| `mitigation` | Risk controls during exception |
| `ticket` | Link to JIRA/GitHub issue |

---

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Checks

1. **Daily:** Expiration check in CI (contract-compliance.yml)
2. **Weekly:** Exception report to #architecture-alerts
3. **Monthly:** ARB review of all active exceptions
4. **Quarterly:** Policy effectiveness review

### Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Active exceptions | < 10 per contract |
| Exception expiration compliance | 100% |
| Average exception duration | < 21 days |
| Emergency exceptions per quarter | < 2 |

---

## Enforcement

### CI Behavior

- **Active exception**: Build passes with warning annotation
- **Expired exception**: Build fails with error
- **Missing exception**: Build fails with error
- **Invalid exception**: Build fails with error

### Runtime Behavior

- Exceptions are logged at WARN level with full context
- Exception usage tracked in metrics
- Alert on expired exception runtime usage

---

## Policy Maintenance

### Review Schedule

| Review Type | Frequency | Owner |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Exception audit | Weekly | Platform Engineering |
| Policy effectiveness | Monthly | Architecture Review Board |
| Full policy review | Quarterly | CTO Office |
| Emergency policy activation | As needed | On-call + Incident Commander |

### Change Process

1. Propose changes via RFC in `docs/governance/rfcs/`
2. ARB review and approval
3. Update this document
4. Announce to engineering teams
5. Update CI validation rules
