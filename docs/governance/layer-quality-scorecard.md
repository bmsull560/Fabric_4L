# Layer Quality Scorecard

This scorecard is a machine-readable governance artifact for release gating.

- Policy source: `docs/governance/layer-quality-threshold-policy.json`
- Generated artifact: `docs/governance/layer-quality-scorecard.json`
- CI markdown summary: `artifacts/layer-quality-scorecard.md`
- Generator: `scripts/ci/layer_quality_scorecard.py`

## Signals tracked per layer

1. `tenant_isolation_tests`
2. `contract_tests`
3. `migration_discipline`
4. `security_negative_paths`
5. `docs_contract_freshness`

## Regression threshold policy

The release gate fails when either condition is violated:

- A layer score drops below `per_layer_min_score`.
- The number of failed layers exceeds `max_failed_layers`.

Current thresholds are defined in the policy JSON and consumed by CI so regressions are visible before release.
