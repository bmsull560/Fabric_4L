# Compatibility Debt Registry

This registry tracks **runtime** compatibility wrappers/shims that exist to preserve backward compatibility while canonical paths are adopted.

## Policy

- New runtime `legacy`/`compatibility` markers require a matching tracker entry here before merge.
- Launch freeze policy: no net-new runtime compatibility wrapper/shim file under canonical runtime roots may merge without explicit Platform Architecture approval recorded here.
- Each entry must include owner, reason, an explicit target removal date, review metadata, and a post-launch removal ticket.
- Entries are reviewed monthly and pruned when removed from runtime.

## Review Cadence

- **Last reviewed:** 2026-05-12 (updated for Layer 3 shim-only inventory, shim conflict cleanup, and exception audit)
- **Next review due:** 2026-06-12
- **Review owner:** Platform Architecture

## Known Intentional Behaviors (Not Shims)

These are deliberate v1 design decisions that raise errors rather than silently degrading. They are documented here to prevent future "fixes" that would weaken the intended behavior.

### Vault config source — `VaultSourceNotSupportedError`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Location** | `services/layer3-knowledge/src/config/manager.py` — `ConfigurationManager._load_from_vault()` |
| **Behavior** | Raises `VaultSourceNotSupportedError` (a `RuntimeError` subclass) when a `ConfigSource` with `type: vault` is loaded. |
| **Intentional since** | v1 |
| **Rationale** | Direct Vault API access via `hvac` is not implemented. Silently returning an empty dict would cause misconfigured services to start with missing secrets, which is worse than a hard failure. |
| **Migration path** | Use External Secrets Operator (ESO) to sync Vault secrets into Kubernetes Secrets, then mount them as environment variables. Change the `ConfigSource` to `type: env`. See `docs/secrets-management.md`. |
| **Test coverage** | `services/layer3-knowledge/tests/test_vault_config_source.py` (7 tests, all passing — verified Sprint 6 2026-05-18) |
| **Do not "fix" by** | Returning `{}`, catching the exception silently, or adding a partial `hvac` integration without a full secrets-management review. |

---

## Monthly Prune Procedure

1. Run `pytest tests/ci/test_compatibility_debt_registry.py`.
2. For each listed path, confirm whether the shim/wrapper still exists and is still required.
3. Remove entries that are no longer present in runtime code.
4. Update `Last reviewed` and `Next review due` dates.
5. If any target date has passed, either remove the shim or add a dated extension note in this file.

## Layer 3 Source Ownership and Exceptions

- **Canonical owner/path:** `value_fabric/layer3` (Layer 3 runtime implementation).
- **Compatibility owner/path:** `services/layer3-knowledge/src` for designated mirrored directories only.
- **Allowed non-mirrored exceptions in service tree:** `api/`, `agents/`, `cache/`, `docs/`, `metrics/`, and top-level `config.py` stay service-local and are not required to exist under `value_fabric/layer3`.
- **Guardrail:** mirrored paths in `services/layer3-knowledge/src` must remain thin `from value_fabric.layer3... import *` shims; implementation logic must not diverge from canonical runtime modules.

| `apps/web/src/stores/userTierStore.ts` (legacy redirects) | canonical route map in same store/module | navigation flows that still hit legacy routes | Medium | Sprint 8 route canonicalization |

## Frontend Compatibility Shim Migration Runbook

### Alias-to-Canonical API Migration

- Start with the compatibility registry row and copy the canonical replacement path into your task notes.
- Use `rg -n "<shim symbol or import path>" apps/web/src` to enumerate all direct and transitive callers.
- Migrate one feature slice at a time (component + hook + tests) to reduce blast radius and ease rollback.
- After each slice, run targeted checks (`pnpm --dir apps/web test -- <suite>` and shim registry check) before deleting shim exports.
- Only remove the shim once callers are zero and the registry row is updated to a dated removal record.


1. **Identify shim usage**: run `rg -n "<alias-or-deprecated-api>" apps/web/src` and collect all callsites.
2. **Switch to canonical API**: replace alias imports/props/hooks with canonical path from this registry, then update nearby tests in the same feature slice.
3. **Verify no remaining callers**: rerun `rg` to confirm zero callsites outside approved shim files.
4. **Remove shim code**: delete deprecated wrapper/alias paths and compatibility tests that only validated shim behavior.
5. **Update registry + CI evidence**: mark the entry removed (strikethrough row), include removal date, and run `pnpm --dir apps/web run check:compatibility-shims-registered`.
