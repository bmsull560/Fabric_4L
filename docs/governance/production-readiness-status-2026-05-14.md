# Production Readiness Status — 2026-05-14

## Summary

```
Production Readiness Status: READY (Track A) / NOT READY (Track B pending)
```

Track A (repository-verifiable work) is complete. Track B (live-environment
validation) is explicitly deferred with documented owners, dependencies, and
target dates in `docs/governance/production-readiness-live-env-deferred.md`.

| 3 | ✅ Complete | `services/layer3-knowledge/src/` | Legacy namespace `value_fabric.layer3_knowledge` removed; CI gate active |
| 4 | ✅ Complete | `services/layer4-agents/src/` | Relative-import restructuring deferred to 2026-09-30 |

## Deferred Items (Track A — Repository)

These items are known gaps that do not block Track A completion but require
follow-up work:

| Item | Owner | Target | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layer 4 relative-import restructuring | Layer 4 Maintainers | 2026-09-30 | Medium — direct service imports blocked until `src/layer4_agents/` restructure |
| Layer 3 Redis KEYS → SCAN | Layer 3 Maintainers | 2026-10-31 | Medium — KEYS is O(N) and blocks Redis event loop under load |
| Layer 3 infra URI in health responses | Layer 3 Maintainers | 2026-10-31 | Low — health endpoints should be auth-gated or redact connection URIs |
| Layer 3 fake health check timing | Layer 3 Maintainers | 2026-10-31 | Low — health check reports timing without actual I/O verification |
| All shim removal reviews (Layers 1–6) | Layer Maintainers | 2026-09-30 | Low — shims are stable; removal is cleanup only |
| Contract tests requiring live services | All teams | Next sprint | Low — tests skip gracefully; need live stack to run |

---

## Track B Deferred Items (Live Environment)

See `docs/governance/production-readiness-live-env-deferred.md` for the full
register. Summary:

| Item | Dependency |
|---|---|
| All 6 services deploy and pass health checks | Bunnyshell / K8s cluster |
| Migrations apply from empty and staging databases | Live database |
| Live smoke tests pass | Live environment |
| Full P0 Playwright workflows pass | Live frontend + backend |
| Prometheus/Grafana dashboards active | Live monitoring stack |
| Alertmanager rules fire correctly | Live alerting |
| Celery workers start and process tasks | Live Redis + workers |
| Neo4j graph schema initialization | Live Neo4j |
| Live LLM provider evidence | Live LLM credentials |
| Enterprise SSO/OIDC provider validation | Live identity provider |

---

## Release Decision

```
Decision: GO (Track A)

Track A (repository-verifiable): All gates pass.
Track B (live-environment): Explicitly deferred with documented plan.

Condition for full production GO:
  Track B items must be validated in a live environment before
  customer-facing traffic is routed to this deployment.
```
