# Security Remediation Verification Report

**Date:** April 26, 2026  
**Scope:** Verification of the 6 critical/high/medium security findings identified in the Phase 1-3 Tenant Management audit.  
**Methodology:** Direct inspection of the committed code on the `main` branch (commit `f5ed728`), followed by a codebase-wide sweep for recurring vulnerable patterns.

## 1. Verification of Specific Fixes

All 6 findings have been successfully and permanently remediated in the codebase.

### F1: Auth Boundary Bypass (Critical)
- **Status:** **Verified Fixed**
- **Location:** `shared/identity/dependencies.py` (Lines 33-63)
- **Confirmation:** The `require_authenticated()` dependency now explicitly checks `if context.auth_source == AUTH_SOURCE_UNKNOWN:` and raises a 401 Unauthorized exception. This prevents any request with an empty or manually constructed context from bypassing the security boundary if the middleware fails open.

### F2: SQL Injection & JSON Corruption (Critical)
- **Status:** **Verified Fixed**
- **Location:** `value-fabric/layer4-agents/src/tenants/api/routes/admin_dashboard.py` (Line 407)
- **Confirmation:** The vulnerable `str(updates["settings"]).replace("'", '"')` pattern has been completely removed. The code now correctly uses `json.dumps(updates["settings"])` to serialize the JSONB payload before passing it to the parameterized query.

### F3: Silent Provisioning Failure (High)
- **Status:** **Verified Fixed**
- **Location:** `value-fabric/layer4-agents/src/tenants/provisioning.py`
- **Confirmation:** All 6 calls to `emit_audit_event()` in the provisioning workflow now include the required `outcome` and `resource_type` parameters. This ensures the audit emitter will not raise a `ValidationError` and silently roll back the provisioning transaction.

### F4: Privilege Escalation (High)
- **Status:** **Verified Fixed**
- **Location:** `shared/identity/models.py` (Lines 133-164)
- **Confirmation:** The `APIKeyCreateRequest` model now includes a `@field_validator` that strictly enforces requested permissions against the `ALLOWED_API_KEY_SCOPES` frozenset. It is no longer possible for a tenant admin to mint an API key with `super_admin` or other out-of-bounds permissions.

### F5: Frozen Dataclass Crash (Medium)
- **Status:** **Verified Fixed**
- **Location:** `shared/identity/context.py` (Line 28)
- **Confirmation:** The `@dataclass(frozen=True)` decorator has been changed to `@dataclass` on the `RequestContext` class. This allows the `require_privileged_access` dependency to successfully mutate `context.privileged_session_start` without crashing the application.

### F6: f-string SQL Injection (Medium)
- **Status:** **Verified Fixed**
- **Location:** `value-fabric/layer4-agents/src/tenants/usage_tracking.py` (Lines 301-325)
- **Confirmation:** The `_count_events_by_field()` method now validates the `group_field` parameter against a hardcoded `_ALLOWED_GROUP_FIELDS` frozenset before interpolating it into the SQL f-string. This eliminates the latent SQL injection risk.

## 2. Codebase-Wide Sweep Results

To ensure these vulnerable patterns were not duplicated elsewhere in the repository, a comprehensive `grep` sweep was performed across all Python files.

| Pattern Swept | Result | Conclusion |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| `str().replace("'", '"')` in SQL context | 0 matches | The naive JSON serialization pattern is completely eradicated. |
| `text(f"...")` without allowlist validation | 8 matches | **Safe.** All 8 matches are either DDL statements (`CREATE SCHEMA {schema_name}`) where the variable is internally generated (e.g., `tenant_{uuid.hex[:8]}`), or static query builders where the f-string only interpolates hardcoded SQL clauses, not user input. |
| `emit_audit_event` missing `outcome` | 0 matches | All audit events across the codebase now pass the required parameters. |
| `frozen=True` on context dataclasses | 22 matches | **Safe.** The remaining frozen dataclasses are either configuration objects, crawler models, or the *canonical contract* examples (`examples/canonical/python/context.py`), which are documentation artifacts, not runtime code. |
| `APIKeyCreateRequest` without validator | 3 matches | **Safe.** The other definitions are in Layer 3, the generated SDK, and an older shared models file. None of these are used by the Layer 4 API key creation endpoint, which uses the secured model. |

## Conclusion

The security remediation is complete, verified, and permanent. The critical vulnerabilities that would have allowed auth bypass and SQL injection have been eradicated, and the codebase is secure against these specific attack vectors.
