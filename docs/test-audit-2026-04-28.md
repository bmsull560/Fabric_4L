# Test Audit — April 28, 2026

## Scope and method

This audit was generated from repository test files under `tests/` using:

- static inventory of `test_*.py` files and `def test_*` functions
- first-introduced file date from Git (`git log --diff-filter=A --follow`)
- end-to-end execution snapshot from `pytest tests -q`

## Portfolio summary

- **Total Python test files (`test_*.py`)**: 101
- **Total discovered test functions (`def test_*`)**: 949
- **10% target volume**: `ceil(949 * 0.10) = 95` tests

## Volume by area and broad test type

| Area | Type | Test count |
|---|---:|---:|
| security | security | 342 |
| k8s | platform | 149 |
| contract | contract | 115 |
| evals | eval | 80 |
| shared | shared | 60 |
| agents | agent | 46 |
| integration | integration | 45 |
| contracts | contract | 34 |
| config | other | 27 |
| arch | architecture | 18 |
| gitops | gitops | 14 |
| state | other | 6 |
| performance | performance | 4 |
| root | other | 4 |
| tools | other | 3 |
| context | other | 2 |
| cache | other | 0 |
| e2e | e2e | 0 |

## Pass-rate snapshot (`pytest tests -q`)

Run result:

- Passed: **447**
- Failed: **197**
- Skipped: **246**
- Errors: **70**
- Total reported outcomes: **960**

Calculated rates:

- **Pass rate vs all outcomes**: `447 / 960 = 46.56%`
- **Pass rate vs executed tests only (pass+fail)**: `447 / (447+197) = 69.41%`
- **Non-executed/error share (skip+error)**: `(246+70)/960 = 32.92%`

## Date audit and oldest 10%

Oldest tests were selected by ascending **file introduction date**, accumulating test counts until at least 95 tests.

- **Oldest cohort target**: 95 tests
- **Selected oldest cohort cumulative**: 105 tests across 18 files

## Refactor actions applied in this change set

Refactor updates were applied to representative files from the oldest cohort to improve maintainability and reduce repetition without changing test intent:

- `tests/contract/test_tool_manifests.py`
  - deterministic manifest ordering (`sorted`)
  - module-scoped manifest cache fixture
  - compact required-field assertion loop
- `tests/evals/skills/test_evaluate_formula.py`
  - module-scoped fixture for trace loading reused across all tests
- `tests/evals/skills/test_semantic_search.py`
  - module-scoped fixture for trace loading reused across all tests
- `tests/arch/test_testability_architecture.py`
  - protocol compliance checks consolidated into one parametrized test
- `tests/gitops/test_rollouts.py`
  - extracted shared YAML loader helper and reduced duplicated file I/O/try blocks
- `tests/contract/test_l2_l3_contract.py`
  - generalized payload schema validation test structure via parametrization
