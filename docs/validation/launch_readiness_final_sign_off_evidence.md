# Launch Readiness Final Sign-Off Evidence

**Author:** Manus AI  
**Scope:** Repository-owned final-testing readiness evidence for Fabric_4L  
**Status:** Repository-owned gate checks passed locally; live production readiness remains environment-dependent.

## Executive Summary

Fabric_4L now has a formal final-testing launch sign-off package that separates **repository-verifiable readiness** from **environment-dependent production evidence**. The new package includes a launch gate validator, a final-testing checklist, a blocker register, an environment-dependent evidence matrix, and a design document explaining the blocker taxonomy and automated gate approach.

The local validation run completed successfully for all repository-owned launch checks. This result means the codebase is structurally ready to enter final testing from a repository perspective. It does **not** mean live production readiness has been proven. The launch-critical gates that require real providers, production-like infrastructure, live telemetry, billing integration, rollback execution, and browser-driven end-to-end validation remain explicitly marked **REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT**.

## 2026-05-08 Core GA Local Hardening Update

The launch-critical deterministic path `account -> signals -> evidence -> driver -> calculator -> business case` was hardened for local repository validation. Fixes focused on runtime contract drift and UI fail-closed behavior in the Account, Driver Tree, ROI Calculator, and Value Levers surfaces, plus a safe analytics bootstrap path that avoids malformed build-time placeholders.

| Gate | Status | Evidence |

| Frontend typecheck | PASS | `pnpm --dir apps/web run check` |
| Frontend production build | PASS | `pnpm --dir apps/web run build` |
| Full frontend Vitest suite | PASS | `pnpm --dir apps/web run test` |
| Journey 24 launch E2E | PASS | `pnpm --dir apps/web run test:e2e:journey-launch` |
| Account provider drift regression | PASS | `cmd /c node_modules\\.bin\\vitest.cmd run src/pages/Accounts.test.tsx --reporter=verbose --pool=forks --poolOptions.forks.singleFork=true` from `apps/web` |
| Targeted Layer 4 agent/workflow tests | PASS | `python -m pytest services/layer4-agents/tests/test_agent_grounding_and_refusal.py services/layer4-agents/tests/test_agent_tool_result_contracts.py services/layer4-agents/tests/test_workflow_canonical_contract.py services/layer4-agents/tests/test_workflow_tenant_isolation.py -q -n 0 -p no:cacheprovider` |

Known limitations remain:

| Item | Status | Required Follow-Up |
|---|---|---|
| Full frontend Vitest suite | PASS LOCALLY | `pnpm --dir apps/web run test` completed successfully on 2026-05-08 after shard-4 isolation; this local evidence does not prove live production readiness. |
| Broad `tests/security` suite | NOT COMPLETED LOCALLY | Prior broad run was environment-dependent/noisy and timed out; security owner should run the intended CI profile. |
| Journey SLO gate | REQUIRES_ARTIFACT | `apps/web/tmp/journey-slo-report.json` or configured `JOURNEY_SLO_REPORT_PATH` must be produced from a synthetic monitor run. |
| Live production readiness | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Staging/live evidence remains required for SSO/OIDC, billing, live LLM provider validation, rollback, telemetry, alert receiver, and performance smoke. |

## Repository-Owned Evidence Completed

| Evidence Area | Artifact | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Final-testing launch gate validator | `scripts/ci/validate_final_testing_launch_gate.py` | PASS | Required launch documents exist, blocker taxonomy is present, environment-only gates are not overclaimed, launch artifact secret hygiene passes, and delegated validators pass. |
| Launch checklist | `docs/launch/final-testing-launch-checklist.md` | COMPLETE | Final-testing entry criteria, sign-off fields, and go/no-go expectations are documented. |
| Launch blocker register | `docs/launch/launch-blocker-register.md` | COMPLETE | P0 Launch Blocker, P1 Launch Blocker, and P2 Follow-Up classifications are defined with owner and evidence fields. |
| Environment evidence matrix | `docs/launch/environment-dependent-evidence-matrix.md` | COMPLETE | All seven live-only launch gates are explicitly marked **REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT**. |
| Gate design document | `docs/validation/final_testing_launch_gate_design.md` | COMPLETE | The blocker taxonomy and repository-level validation strategy are documented. |

## Local Validation Transcript Summary

The following commands were executed locally from the repository root and completed successfully:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `python3 -m py_compile scripts/ci/validate_final_testing_launch_gate.py` | PASS |
| `python3 scripts/ci/validate_final_testing_launch_gate.py` | PASS |
| `python3 scripts/ci/validate_production_readiness_plan.py` | PASS |
| `python3 scripts/ci/platform_contract_lint.py` | PASS: `0 errors, 0 warnings` |
| `python3 scripts/ci/check_dependabot_coverage.py` | PASS: `8 pip, 4 npm, 7 docker, 19 total manifest locations covered` |

> The launch gate validator prints an explicit caution: this gate validates repository-owned final-testing readiness only; live production PASS still requires environment evidence.

## Environment-Dependent Gates Not Yet Claimed as PASS

The following gates remain outside repository-only validation. They must be executed in a properly configured staging, provider sandbox, or production-like environment before live launch readiness can be claimed.

| Environment Gate | Current Status | Required Owner | Required Evidence Before Production PASS |
|---|---|---|---|
| Production-like E2E launch rehearsal | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Test owner | Browser-executed critical journey, real authentication, live backing services, persisted state, logs, screenshots or transcript, and release-candidate SHA. |
| Enterprise SSO/OIDC provider validation | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Identity owner | Provider configuration proof, login/logout validation, failed-login behavior, role/group mapping, and redacted audit event. |
| Notification and alert receiver validation | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | SRE owner | Provider test delivery, alert receiver proof, escalation route, and acknowledgement record. |
| Telemetry dashboard and alert validation | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Observability owner | Dashboard link, metric/log/trace sample, alert rule proof, threshold rationale, and redaction sample. |
| Billing and metering provider validation | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Billing owner | Meter event sample, idempotency proof, reconciliation check, invoice or usage aggregation sample, and owner sign-off. |
| Rollback and restore drill | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | SRE owner | Rollback command transcript, restore proof, data-integrity check, timing result, and approval record. |
| Performance and reliability smoke test | REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT | Performance owner | Smoke-test command, environment shape, release-candidate SHA, latency/error-rate output, and saturation notes. |

## Launch Review Position

The current launch-review posture is disciplined and evidence-based. The repository now provides a clean gate for final-testing entry, but it avoids overstating production readiness where live evidence has not yet been gathered. This supports a high-standard launch review by making the remaining risk visible, owned, and decision-ready.

| Decision Question | Current Answer |
|---|---|
| Can the repository-owned final-testing gate be run locally? | Yes. It passed locally. |
| Are P0/P1/P2 blocker classifications documented? | Yes. They are documented in the launch checklist and blocker register. |
| Are live-only validations clearly separated from repository checks? | Yes. The environment matrix marks all seven required gates as **REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT**. |
| Are raw secrets present in launch-readiness artifacts? | No unsafe secret-like values were found by the new launch gate validator. |
| Is production launch PASS claimed? | No. Production PASS remains dependent on real environment evidence. |

## Required Next Actions Before Launch

Final testing should proceed only after a release candidate SHA is selected and the owners in the environment-dependent evidence matrix are assigned. The launch team should execute the seven **REQUIRES_ENVIRONMENT** gates, attach redacted evidence, and update the blocker register with any failures or waivers. Workflow-file integration for the new gate should be performed later by a maintainer with workflow-write permission, because this task intentionally avoided modifying `.github/workflows/`.
