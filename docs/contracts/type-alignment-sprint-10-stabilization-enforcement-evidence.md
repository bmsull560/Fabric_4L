# Type Alignment Sprint 10 Stabilization and Enforcement Evidence

## Summary

Sprint 10 stabilized the type-alignment work completed across Sprints 1–9 by adding an automated **trust-boundary regression guard**. The guard prevents migrated frontend boundaries from reintroducing unsafe `response.data as ...` assertions and prevents selected migrated stream handlers from reintroducing direct `JSON.parse(...)` calls inside hook/client files.

The implementation deliberately protects the migrated files that already have schema-owned parsers, rather than attempting to ban all assertions across the repository. This keeps the enforcement actionable: a future regression in a migrated boundary fails with a file, line, snippet, rule kind, and remediation message, while lower-risk or not-yet-migrated areas remain available for later inventory-driven cleanup.

## Changed Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/lib/quality/trustBoundaryGuard.ts` | Adds the reusable scanner, protected migrated file lists, rule definitions, violation formatting, and repository scan helper. |
| `apps/web/src/lib/quality/trustBoundaryGuard.test.ts` | Adds focused Vitest coverage for safe parser usage, unsafe response-cast regression detection, unsafe direct stream JSON parsing detection, and out-of-scope JSON parsing behavior. |
| `apps/web/scripts/security/assert-trust-boundary-parsers.ts` | Adds the executable guard used by package scripts and verification gates. |
| `apps/web/package.json` | Adds `pnpm run test:trust-boundaries` as the direct command for the guard. |
| `apps/web/scripts/quality/verify-frontend.mjs` | Wires the guard into the frontend verification sequence before broad unit/component tests. |

## Enforcement Scope

The guard covers files migrated in the preceding type-alignment sprints. Response boundaries are checked for `response.data as`, and stream boundaries are checked for direct `JSON.parse(` usage so parsing remains centralized in schema-aware helpers.

| Rule | Protected Files | Failure Pattern | Required Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Response data cast guard | `useProducts.ts`, `useGroundTruthGovernance.ts`, `useCompetitiveIntel.ts`, `useEvidence.ts`, `useHealthMonitor.ts`, `useIntegrations.ts`, `useProvenance.ts`, `useWorkflows.ts` | `response.data as` | Replace the assertion with the schema-owned parser for the boundary. |
| Direct stream JSON parse guard | `AgentEventClient.ts`, `useJobStream.ts`, `useWorkflows.ts` | `JSON.parse(` | Use the centralized stream parser helpers such as `parseJsonObject`, `parseAgentEventFromJson`, `parseJobStreamEventFromJson`, or the workflow stream parser. |

## Test Coverage

The guard has focused automated coverage in `trustBoundaryGuard.test.ts`. The tests exercise both passing and failing paths so the guard does not silently become a no-op.

| Coverage Area | Test Outcome |
|---|---|
| Safe migrated response handling | Confirms a protected hook using `parseEvidenceListResponse(response.data)` produces no violations. |
| Unsafe response-cast regression | Confirms `response.data as CompetitiveLandscapeResponse` in a protected hook produces a `response-data-cast` violation with remediation text. |
| Unsafe stream JSON parsing regression | Confirms `JSON.parse(raw)` in a protected stream file produces a `direct-json-parse` violation with remediation text. |
| Out-of-scope parser usage | Confirms JSON parsing in a non-protected ontology example is not flagged by this targeted stabilization guard. |

## Regression Validation Evidence

Validation was run after formatting the touched files. The focused runtime-boundary regression suite re-ran the schema parser suites created during Sprints 1–9 together with the new guard tests and the guard command. Additional broad checks covered frontend typechecking, contract freshness, production build, and whitespace validation.

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Guard unit tests | PASS | `pnpm exec vitest run src/lib/quality/trustBoundaryGuard.test.ts` completed with **1 passed file** and **4 passed tests** during the focused guard run. |
| Guard command | PASS | `pnpm run test:trust-boundaries` reported: `Trust-boundary enforcement passed: migrated boundaries contain no unsafe response.data casts or direct stream JSON.parse calls.` |
| Migrated boundary parser regression | PASS | `pnpm exec vitest run` across product, ground-truth governance, competitive-intelligence, evidence, AGUI stream, health-monitor, integrations, provenance, and trust-boundary guard suites completed with **9 passed files** and **66 passed tests**. |
| Frontend typecheck | PASS | `pnpm run check` completed successfully in `apps/web`. |
| Contract freshness gate | PASS | `scripts/ci/check_contract_freshness.sh` completed with exit status `0` and reported that OpenAPI contracts and generated frontend DTO types are current. |
| Production build | PASS | `pnpm run build` completed successfully after the contract freshness gate; Vite produced the production bundle with the existing large-chunk warning only. |
| Whitespace validation | PASS | `git diff --check` completed with exit status `0` during the stabilization regression run. |
| Broad Vitest suite observation | NON-BLOCKING EXISTING INSTABILITY | A full `pnpm test` run executed **86 files / 1,238 tests**, with **78 files / 1,203 tests passing** and **35 failures** concentrated in graph-query, workspace-tab, graph-utils, GraphExplorer, and one L5 OpenAPI fixture assertion. Representative failures involve existing graph fixture shape expectations and a `TruthObjectResponse` fixture missing `tenant_id`; they are outside the new guard files and should be handled in a separate graph/OpenAPI fixture stabilization sprint. |

## Residual Risks and Follow-Up

The new guard protects the completed migrated trust-boundary surface, but it is intentionally scoped. It does not yet convert or ban every assertion pattern in the frontend because the remaining inventory contains a mixture of lower-risk internal narrowing, unreviewed legacy hooks, tests, and generated or fixture-driven code. Expanding the guard should happen sprint-by-sprint as additional boundaries are migrated.

| Follow-Up | Recommended Priority | Rationale |
|---|---:|---|
| Stabilize broad graph and OpenAPI fixture tests | P1 | Full `pnpm test` currently reports unrelated existing failures, so a dedicated graph/OpenAPI fixture stabilization sprint would improve repository-wide regression confidence. |
| Expand protected trust-boundary file list after each future migration | P1 | The guard is most useful when newly migrated boundaries are added immediately after parser migration. |
| Add CI documentation for `test:trust-boundaries` | P2 | The command is wired into frontend verification, but contributor-facing docs can make the trust-boundary convention more discoverable. |
| Continue lower-risk boundary inventory | P2 | Remaining casts and parser sites should be ranked by runtime risk before broadening enforcement. |

## Handoff Recommendation

After Sprint 10, the next highest-value work is a **graph/OpenAPI fixture stabilization sprint**. That work should focus on making the broad Vitest suite reliable before migrating additional lower-risk boundaries, because the new trust-boundary guard already protects the completed Sprints 1–9 runtime-boundary migrations from direct regression.
