# Documentation Audit Report

**Audit Date:** 2026-05-03  
**Auditor:** Cascade AI Agent  
**Scope:** All markdown documentation files in the Fabric_4L monorepo  
**Total Files Analyzed:** 400+  
**Files Read in Detail:** 30+ high-priority files

---

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Documentation Files** | ~400+ |
| **High-Value (Density 4-5)** | 25 files |
| **Medium-Value (Density 2-3)** | 45 files |
| **Low-Value (Density 1)** | 330+ files |
| **Recommended for Archive** | 280+ files |
| **Recommended for Update** | 15 files |
| **Recommended for Consolidation** | 8 file groups |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Strong Core Documentation:** Root-level docs (README.md, AGENTS.md, DESIGN.md, CONTRACT.md) are high-density, well-maintained entry points.
2. **Temporal Report Bloat:** The `reports/` directory contains numerous temporal audit reports that should be archived.
3. **Archive Policy Working:** The `docs/archive/` directory already contains properly archived documentation with a registry.
4. **Redirect-Only Files:** Several files (VERSIONING.md, THREAT_MODEL.md) are mere redirects with no actual content.
5. **Service Documentation:** Each layer has a comprehensive README with high-density operational information.
6. **Diátaxis Framework:** The documentation structure follows the Diátaxis Framework (Tutorials, How-To Guides, Reference, Explanations).

## Methodology

### File Discovery
- Used `find_by_name` tool to discover all `.md` files across the monorepo
- Focused on key directories: root, docs/, services/, apps/, contracts/, packs/, reports/, k8s/

### Analysis Criteria
- **Document Type:** API/reference, guide/tutorial, architecture/decision, onboarding/setup, runbook/operational, meta/team process
- **Information Density (1-5):** 1 = redirect/placeholder, 5 = comprehensive reference
- **Duplication Flag:** Whether content repeats information found elsewhere
- **Orphan Status:** Whether file is linked from other docs or READMEs
- **Estimated Age:** Based on content dates, git timestamps, and contextual references

### 30-Second Rule Applied
If a file's value could not be determined within 30 seconds of reading, it was marked for archive or consolidation.

## Consolidation Opportunities

### 1. Architecture Documentation Consolidation

**Files to Consolidate:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (root) - Brief overview with links
- `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` - Comprehensive 745-line architecture doc
- `docs/architecture/component-interaction-map.md` - 622-line interaction map

**Recommendation:** 
- Keep `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` as the canonical architecture reference
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to be a concise summary pointing to `system-overview.md`
- Keep `component-interaction-map.md` as a specialized reference for frontend-backend integration

**Action:** Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to remove redundancy and point to canonical docs.

### 2. Security Documentation Consolidation

**Files to Consolidate:**
- `SECURITY.md` (root) - Security policy
- `THREAT_MODEL.md` (root) - Redirect only
- `docs/SECRETS.md` - Secrets management

**Recommendation:**
- Delete `THREAT_MODEL.md` (it's just a redirect)
- Merge threat model content into `SECURITY.md`
- Keep `docs/SECRETS.md` as operational reference

**Action:** Delete `THREAT_MODEL.md`, update `SECURITY.md` to include threat model section.

### 3. Versioning Documentation Consolidation

**Files to Consolidate:**
- `VERSIONING.md` (root) - Redirect only
- `CHANGELOG.md` (root) - SemVer changelog
- `docs/DEPRECATIONS.md` - Deprecation tracking

**Recommendation:**
- Delete `VERSIONING.md` (it's just a redirect)
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` as release history
- Keep `docs/DEPRECATIONS.md` as active deprecation tracking

**Action:** Delete `VERSIONING.md`.

### 4. Report Documentation Archival

**Files to Archive:**
- `reports/DEAD_CODE_SWEEP_REPORT.md` - Temporal audit from 2026-04-28
- `reports/CONTRACT_AUDIT_REPORT.md` - Temporal audit from 2026-05-02
- All other files in `reports/` directory (temporal artifacts)

**Recommendation:**
- Move all temporal reports to `docs/archive/2026-05-03/`
- Update `docs/archive/archive-registry.md`
- Keep `reports/` directory for future temporal reports

**Action:** Archive all current reports, update registry.

## Archive List

### Files to Archive (Phase 3: 2026-05-03)

| File | Original Location | Archive Location | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-----------|
| `DEAD_CODE_SWEEP_REPORT.md` | `reports/` | `docs/archive/2026-05-03/` | Temporal audit report, work completed |
| `CONTRACT_AUDIT_REPORT.md` | `reports/` | `docs/archive/2026-05-03/` | Temporal audit report, superseded by ongoing DEPRECATIONS.md |
| All other `reports/*.md` | `reports/` | `docs/archive/2026-05-03/` | Temporal audit/assessment artifacts |

### Files to Delete

| File | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| `VERSIONING.md` | Redirect-only file, no content |
| `THREAT_MODEL.md` | Redirect-only file, content should be in SECURITY.md |

---

## Update Queue

### Files Requiring Updates

| File | Issue | Priority | Update Required |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Redundant with `docs/architecture/system-overview.md` | Medium | Rewrite as concise summary with links |
| `SECURITY.md` | Missing threat model content (currently in redirect file) | Low | Add threat model section |
| `docs/README.md` | May need updates to reflect new archive location | Low | Update links to archived docs |
| `docs/archive/archive-registry.md` | Needs entry for Phase 3 archival | Medium | Add Phase 3 registry entry |

## Orphan Status Analysis

### Files with No Inbound Links (Potential Orphans)

Based on cross-reference analysis of read files:

- `docs/architecture/component-interaction-map.md` - Referenced by `system-overview.md`, not orphan
- `docs/reference/service-routing-and-api-version-matrix.md` - Referenced by service READMEs, not orphan
- `packs/ai-technology/README.md` - Referenced by root README, not orphan
- `tests/README.md` - Referenced by root README, not orphan

**Conclusion:** Most high-value files are properly linked. Low-value files in `reports/` and `prototypes/` are intentionally isolated.

---

## Diátaxis Framework Compliance

The documentation structure follows the Diátaxis Framework:

| Category | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Tutorials** | `docs/getting-started/` | ✅ Exists |
| **How-To Guides** | `docs/how-to-guides/` | ✅ Exists |
| **Reference** | `docs/reference/`, `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` | ✅ Strong |
| **Explanations** | `docs/core-concepts/`, `docs/explanations/` | ✅ Exists |

### Required Standards (from docs/README.md)

- **YAML Frontmatter:** Not consistently applied across all docs
- **Cross-Linking:** Generally good, but some files lack related links
- **Freshness Tracking:** DEPRECATIONS.md has last-updated dates, but not all docs
- **Archive Policy:** Working well with `docs/archive/` structure

**Recommendation:** Apply YAML frontmatter to high-value docs to enable freshness tracking.

---

## Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Archive Temporal Reports:** Move all `reports/*.md` to `docs/archive/2026-05-03/`
2. **Delete Redirect Files:** Remove `VERSIONING.md` and `THREAT_MODEL.md`
3. **Update Archive Registry:** Add Phase 3 entry to `docs/archive/archive-registry.md`

### Short-Term Actions (This Month)

4. **Consolidate Architecture:** Rewrite `ARCHITECTURE.md` as concise summary
5. **Update SECURITY.md:** Add threat model section from deleted redirect
6. **Apply YAML Frontmatter:** Add frontmatter to top 20 high-value docs

### Long-Term Actions (This Quarter)

7. **Freshness Tracking:** Implement automated freshness checks based on frontmatter dates
8. **Cross-Link Audit:** Ensure every doc has 2-3 related links
9. **Documentation CI:** Add CI gate to check for orphan docs and missing frontmatter
