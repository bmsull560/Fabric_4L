# Fabric 4L Canonical Platform Contract — Engineering Specification

## TL;DR

Fabric 4L currently bleeds velocity because six critical cross-layer concerns each have 2–3 partially-good patterns competing simultaneously. This document specifies a single unambiguous canonical contract for each concern, paired with automated enforcement and a concrete deprecation map. The goal is to convert Fabric 4L from an evolving codebase into a governed product platform where the right way is the easy way, and the wrong way fails CI.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The single biggest drag on Fabric 4L is not lack of ideas or components. It is the presence of multiple partially-good patterns competing across every layer. This pattern competition creates compounding slowdown that affects architecture review, implementation, test design, CI gating, onboarding, and bug triage.

The most effective action is to create and enforce one canonical contract for the whole platform across six specific dimensions, with four concrete deliverables: an architecture contract doc, a canonical reference implementation, automated lint and CI enforcement, and a deprecation map for non-canonical patterns.

## 2. The Six Canonical Contracts

### 2.1 Tenant Context Propagation

**Status:** `proposed` | **Target:** `ratified` 2026-05-23 | **Enforcement:** 2026-06-23

**Canonical Pattern:** Request-Scoped Async Context with Middleware Injection

Tenant context flows as an immutable request-scoped object established at the authentication boundary and propagated automatically across all asynchronous boundaries via AsyncLocalStorage. It is never passed as an explicit function parameter.

**Contract Rules:**
- Storage mechanism: AsyncLocalStorage (Node.js) or language-equivalent
- Initial injection: Single auth middleware validates JWT/headers, extracts tenant_id
- Propagation: Automatic via AsyncLocalStorage.run()
- Cross-service propagation: `x-fabric-tenant-id` header with signature verification
- Message queue propagation: Explicit tenant_id field in every message payload
- Access pattern: `getTenantContext()` helper; returns null if called outside scope
- Required fields: tenant_id (UUIDv4), tenant_tier (shared|dedicated|enterprise), region, issued_at, scope
- Immutability: Context object is deeply frozen; modifications via `withTenantContext(ctx, overrides)`
- Lifetime: Context lives for duration of request async scope

**Anti-patterns being deprecated:**
- Passing tenantId as parameter through service layers (parameter pollution)
- Reading tenant ID directly from req.headers or JWT claims outside auth middleware
- Storing mutable tenant state on request object
- Deriving tenant context differently in different services

**Enforcement:**
- ESLint: `no-tenant-id-parameter` - flags function parameters named tenantId variants
- ESLint: `no-req-tenant-access` - flags direct header access outside auth middleware
- Runtime: getTenantContext() returns null outside async scope (fail-safe)
- Integration test: Cross-tenant isolation test runs on every CI build

### 2.2 DB Session and Isolation Pattern

**Status:** `proposed` | **Target:** `ratified` 2026-05-23 | **Enforcement:** 2026-06-23

**Canonical Pattern:** Tiered Isolation with Pooled Shared-Schema Default and Row-Level Security

The database isolation strategy matches the tenant tier specified in tenant context. Default is pooled shared-schema with mandatory tenant_id columns and RLS policies.

**Contract Specification:**

| Tenant Tier | Isolation Model | Connection Strategy | Migration Strategy |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| shared (default, ~95%) | Shared schema, tenant_id column, PostgreSQL RLS | Pooled via PgBouncer; SET app.current_tenant = ? | Single migration applies to all |
| dedicated (~4%) | Dedicated schema per tenant (tenant_{id}) | Schema-routed connection; search_path set per request | Migrations per schema |
| enterprise (~1%) | Dedicated database instance | Separate connection pool per tenant | Migrations per database |

**Contract Rules:**
- Every tenant-scoped table must have tenant_id column with NOT NULL constraint
- Every query must include tenant scoping via ORM automatic application
- RLS policies on every tenant-scoped table using app.current_tenant
- Connection acquisition through TenantAwarePool only
- Cross-tenant queries require BYPASS RLS role with audit logging

**Reference Implementation Pattern:**
- Canonical: `db.getSession()` - reads tenant from async scope automatically
- Deprecated: `db.connect(tenantId)` or `db.withTenant(tenantId)` with explicit parameter

**Anti-patterns being deprecated:**
- Ad-hoc tenant ID in raw SQL queries outside migrations/analytics
- Separate connection management per service with different pooling strategies
- tenant_id as optional/defaultable parameter
- Cross-tenant aggregation without RLS bypass authorization

**Enforcement:**
- ESLint: `no-raw-tenant-query` - detects raw SQL with tenant_id outside approved locations
- ESLint: `no-explicit-db-connect` - flags db.connect() with tenant identifiers
- Integration tests: Application-level and database-level RLS tests

---

### 2.3 Middleware and Auth Flow

**Status:** `proposed` | **Target:** `ratified` 2026-05-23 | **Enforcement:** 2026-06-23

**Canonical Pattern:** Layered Middleware Stack with Declarable, Composable Phases

Request processing pipeline organized as strict ordered stack of eight phases. Each phase is a pure function that takes a context object and returns modified context or throws error.

**Contract Specification:**

| Phase | Order | Responsibility | Context Modifications | Can Terminate |
|-------|-------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| request_id | 1 | Assign x-request-id | Sets ctx.requestId | No |
| correlation | 2 | Extract/inject correlation IDs | Sets ctx.traceId, ctx.span | No |
| auth | 3 | Validate credentials, establish tenant context | Sets ctx.identity, ctx.tenantContext | Yes (401/403) |
| tenant_scope | 4 | Validate tenant access | May modify ctx.tenantContext.scope | Yes (403) |
| rate_limit | 5 | Apply rate limiting | No modifications | Yes (429) |
| validation | 6 | Validate request against OpenAPI | Sets ctx.validatedBody, ctx.validatedParams | Yes (400) |
| handler | 7 | Execute business logic | Sets ctx.result | Yes |
| response | 8 | Serialize response | Sets response body/headers | No |
| error_boundary | Global | Catch errors, normalize shape | Sets response body/status | Yes |

**Contract Rules:**
- Every route must declare required phases in route manifest
- Auth phase produces AuthContext; downstream code never re-validates
- Rate limiting keyed by tenant_id + endpoint_pattern + identity_hash
- Request/response validated against OpenAPI spec using generated validators
- Error responses follow canonical error shape (section 2.5)

**Anti-patterns being deprecated:**
- Inline app.use(middleware) scattered across route files
- Route handlers re-verifying authentication after middleware
- Per-route custom validation schemas duplicating OpenAPI
- Middleware sending HTTP responses directly instead of setting context

**Enforcement:**
- ESLint: `no-inline-middleware` - flags app.use() outside pipeline config
- CI: OpenAPI spec diff validation on PRs modifying routes
- Runtime: Middleware manifest validator at application startup

---

### 2.4 Tool Invocation Boundary

**Status:** `proposed` | **Target:** `ratified` 2026-05-23 | **Enforcement:** 2026-06-23

**Canonical Pattern:** Schema-First Unified Tool Registry with Generated Framework Bindings

Every tool is defined once as strongly-typed function with JSON Schema input contract and typed output. Framework bindings (LangChain, CrewAI, MCP) are thin auto-generated wrappers.

**Contract Specification:**

| Concern | Canonical Decision | Rationale |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Tool definition | TypeScript function with typed inputs/outputs; JSON Schema generated | Single implementation; type safety; schema consistency |
| Tool registration | Central ToolRegistry with full metadata | Single discovery point; validation, permissions, observability |
| Framework binding | Thin auto-generated wrapper, max 10 lines, no logic | Eliminates duplicated business logic |
| Authentication | Tool inherits tenant context from orchestrating agent | No cross-tenant access possible |
| Error handling | Tool errors normalized to canonical shape | Agents can reason about failures |
| Observability | OpenTelemetry span per tool call with tool name, latency, tenant ID | Complete traceability |
| Tool description | Mandatory, min 50 chars, include when to use, when not, example | LLM selection accuracy |
| Input schema | JSON Schema with descriptions on every field; max 5-8 top-level params | LLM performance |

**Tool Output Contract (Canonical Shape):**

```typescript
interface ToolResult<T> {
  status: "success" | "error" | "partial";
  data?: T;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    recoverable: boolean;
    details?: Record<string, unknown>;
  };
  metadata: {
    execution_time_ms: number;
    tenant_id: string;
    tool_version: string;
    trace_id: string;
  };
}
```

**Anti-patterns being deprecated:**
- Tools defined as inline lambdas in agent configuration
- Framework-specific tool definitions duplicating business logic
- Tools throwing JavaScript exceptions instead of structured errors
- Tools accessing tenant context via function parameters
- Tools with ambiguous or missing JSON Schema descriptions

**Enforcement:**
- ESLint: `no-inline-tool-definition` - flags tool implementations outside tools/ directory
- ESLint: `no-throw-in-tool` - flags throw statements in tool implementations
- CI: Tool registry validation at build time
- CI: Framework binding parity check

---

### 2.5 Agent Output Shape and Traceability

**Status:** `proposed` | **Target:** `ratified` 2026-05-23 | **Enforcement:** 2026-06-23

**Canonical Pattern:** Structured Generation with Pydantic Schema Enforcement and OpenTelemetry Tracing

All agent outputs produced through structured generation using function calling/tool use mode with defined Pydantic schema. Raw text generation reserved for conversational endpoints only.

**Contract Specification:**

| Concern | Canonical Decision | Rationale |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Output mode | Structured tool-use with Pydantic schema | Schema enforcement at generation time |
| Schema validation | Pydantic model_validate() on every output | Catches violations; errors fed back for retry |
| Retry policy | Max 2 retries on validation failure; return typed default after | Prevents infinite loops; ensures structured response |
| Traceability | OpenTelemetry spans for planning, tool selection, execution, validation | Complete visibility |
| Session management | Session ID via x-fabric-session-id; state changes as OTel span events | Cross-request continuity |
| Output persistence | Every output stored with session ID, trace ID, input hash, output JSON | Audit trail; replay testing |
| Raw text fallback | Only for endpoints marked output_mode: "text" | Prevents accidental unstructured output |
| Model version pinning | Exact model version specified; changes require config update | Prevents silent behavior changes |

**Canonical Agent Output Shape:**

```typescript
interface AgentOutput<T> {
  result: T;
  reasoning?: string;
  tool_calls: ToolCall[];
  confidence: number;
  trace_id: string;
  session_id: string;
  metadata: {
    model: string;
    model_version: string;
    latency_ms: number;
    token_usage: { prompt: number; completion: number; total: number };
    validation_passed: boolean;
    retry_count: number;
    finish_reason: string;
  };
}

interface ToolCall {
  tool_name: string;
  input_hash: string;
  output_status: "success" | "error" | "partial";
  latency_ms: number;
  span_id: string;
}
```

**Anti-patterns being deprecated:**
- JSON mode or raw text parsing of agent outputs
- Inline JSON.parse() calls on LLM response variables
- Agent runs without trace IDs or session correlation
- Storing raw prompts/completions in application logs (PII exposure)

**Enforcement:**
- TypeScript: All agent outputs must conform to defined Pydantic model
- ESLint: `no-json-parse-agent-output` - flags JSON.parse() on LLM responses
- CI: OTel trace validation - verifies minimum required spans
- Runtime: Unstructured outputs rejected at boundary

---

### 2.6 UI State Progression and Route Model

**Status:** `proposed` | **Target:** `ratified` 2026-05-23 | **Enforcement:** 2026-06-23

**Canonical Pattern:** State-Machine-Driven Navigation with Declarative Route Manifests

UI state progression modeled as finite state machine where states correspond to pages/screens and transitions correspond to user actions or workflow events.

**Contract Specification:**

| Concern | Canonical Decision | Rationale |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Routing model | URL path maps to state machine state; state machine determines valid transitions | Prevents invalid state navigation |
| State definition | id, route (URL pattern), guards, onEnter, transitions | Complete declarative specification |
| Navigation API | navigate(toState, params?) - validates transition before executing | Invalid transitions are no-ops with warnings |
| Deep linking | URL translated to state on load; redirect if invalid | Supports bookmarking |
| Route guards | Pure functions reading tenant context; no side effects | Deterministic, testable |
| Back navigation | Uses state machine history stack, not browser history | Respects workflow constraints |
| Programmatic navigation | Only via navigate(); no direct URL manipulation | Centralized for logging/analytics |

**Route Manifest Pattern:**

```typescript
const routeManifest: RouteManifest = {
  "/dashboard": {
    state: "dashboard",
    guards: [requireTenantContext, requireActiveSession],
    onEnter: [trackPageView("dashboard"), fetchDashboardData],
    transitions: {
      "VIEW_ANALYTICS": "analytics",
      "MANAGE_SETTINGS": "settings",
    },
  },
};
```

**Anti-patterns being deprecated:**
- Imperative router.push("/path") calls scattered through handlers
- Route guards performing API calls or mutations
- URL string concatenation for path construction
- Browser history as source of truth for workflow state
- Components rendering based on direct URL parsing

**Enforcement:**
- ESLint: `no-imperative-navigation` - flags router.push(), history.push(), direct navigate()
- ESLint: `no-url-concatenation` - flags string concatenation producing URL-like paths
- CI: Route manifest validation at build time
- CI: Dead transition detection

## 5. Why This Is the Highest ROI Move

This investment converts Fabric 4L from a smart evolving codebase into a governed product platform. That conversion produces velocity without chaos — the ability to move fast because the path is clear, not because the constraints are absent.

**Measurable impact within one quarter:**

| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Time to implement new tool | 2-3 days | 4 hours | Engineering time tracking |
| Cross-tenant data leak incidents | 1/quarter | Zero | Security incident tracker |
| Architecture review rounds per PR | 2.3 avg | 1.0 | PR analytics |
| New engineer time to first correct PR | 3 weeks | 5 days | Onboarding survey |
| Deprecated pattern instances | Growing | -20%/quarter | Weekly static analysis |
| CI failure rate from contract violations | Not measured | Zero | CI analytics |

These savings compound quarter over quarter.
