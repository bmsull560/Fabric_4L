"""
Canonical Artifact Contracts — Phase 3 of the Ontology Contract Migration.

These Pydantic models define the typed boundaries between agents in the
Value Fabric pipeline. Every agent MUST accept and produce these artifacts.

Agent ownership:
  ContextArtifact    ← owned by ContextExtractionAgent
  ValueModelArtifact ← owned by ValueModelAgent
  IntegrityArtifact  ← owned by IntegrityAgent
  NarrativeArtifact  ← owned by NarrativeAgent

Import from here:
    from value_fabric.layer4_agents.src.contracts import (
        EntityRef, ContextArtifact, ValueModelArtifact,
        IntegrityArtifact, NarrativeArtifact,
    )
