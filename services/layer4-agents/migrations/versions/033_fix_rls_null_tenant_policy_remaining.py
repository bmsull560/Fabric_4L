"""Fix NULL-permissive RLS policies introduced after migration 026.

Revision ID: 033
Revises: 032
Create Date: 2026-05-17

SECURITY FIX: Three migration groups created tables with the unsafe pattern:

    USING (tenant_id IS NULL OR tenant_id::text = current_setting(...))

This allows any row inserted without a tenant_id to be visible to ALL tenants.
Migration 026 fixed the original 007/013 tables; migration 028 fixed the 027
batch. This migration closes the remaining gaps:

  - Billing tables (025): billing_charges, billing_customers,
    billing_invoice_items, billing_invoices, billing_subscriptions,
    billing_usage_events, billing_webhook_events
  - Company knowledge tables (029): company_knowledge_profiles, icp_profiles,
    knowledge_sources, value_extraction_records
  - CRM sync jobs (030): crm_sync_jobs

The fix replaces the USING clause with strict matching only:

    USING (tenant_id::text = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true))

Rows with NULL tenant_id become invisible to tenant-scoped queries and are
only accessible via the existing admin_bypass_policy (admin_role, system_role
with empty app.tenant_id setting).
