# Task 42: HashiCorp Vault Integration - Implementation Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** 2026-04-19  
**Scope:** Verification-first approach with cross-layer Vault health checks and production wiring

---

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Discovery & Gap Analysis ✅
- Confirmed no `vault.example.com` placeholder remains in the codebase
- Identified Vault health check was only implemented in Layer 4
- Cataloged all existing Vault integration files

### Phase 2: Cross-Layer Vault Health Checks ✅
Added production Vault smoke gate to all layers:

| Layer | File | Pattern Used |
|-------|------|--------------|
| L1 | `value-fabric/layer1-ingestion/src/api/main.py` | `@app.on_event("startup")` |
| L2 | `value-fabric/layer2-extraction/src/layer2_extraction/api/main.py` | `@app.on_event("startup")` |
| L3 | `value-fabric/layer3-knowledge/src/api/main.py` | `lifespan()` function |
| L4 | `value-fabric/layer4-agents/src/api/main.py` | `lifespan()` (already existed) |
| L5 | `value-fabric/layer5-ground-truth/src/layer5_ground_truth/api/main.py` | `lifespan()` function |

Each layer:
- Imports `check_vault_health` from `shared.identity.vault_check`
- Checks `ENVIRONMENT=production` and `VAULT_ADDR` set
- Hard-fails startup if Vault unreachable (same error message across all layers)
- Gracefully handles import failures (development mode without shared package)

### Phase 3: Vault Policies as Code ✅
Created new policy files in `k8s/vault/policies/`:
- `external-secrets.hcl` - For External Secrets Operator (DB creds + static secrets)
- `value-fabric-layers.hcl` - For layer services (layer-specific DB roles + shared secrets)
- `value-fabric-admin.hcl` - For admin operations (full secret access + rotation)

### Phase 4: Kubernetes Auth Roles ✅
Created `k8s/vault/k8s-auth-roles.yaml` with:
- ConfigMap documenting role configurations
- ServiceAccount definitions for external-secrets and all layers
- Annotations linking SAs to Vault roles

### Phase 5: Enhanced Smoke Tests ✅
Updated `scripts/smoke/vault_smoke.py`:
- Added all 5 required secret paths (llm, database, auth, infrastructure, inter-layer)
- Added all 5 dynamic credential roles (app-role, layer1-app through layer4-app)
- Changed from single-role test to multi-role test with per-role reporting
- Non-zero exit if no roles working

Created `scripts/smoke/clustersecretstore_check.py`:
- Checks ClusterSecretStore Ready status
- Lists all ExternalSecrets in value-fabric namespace
- Verifies ExternalSecret sync status
- Reports synced Kubernetes Secrets

### Phase 6: ClusterSecretStore Hardening ✅
Updated `k8s/external-secrets/cluster-secret-store.yaml`:
- Added TLS configuration comments for production
- Added prerequisites documentation
- Documented caProvider block for TLS certs

### Phase 7: Documentation ✅
Updated `docs/secrets-management.md`:
- Added Verification section with kubectl commands
- Added Troubleshooting ExternalSecret Sync section
- Added dynamic credential rotation commands
- Updated smoke gate section with new scripts

Created `docs/operations/VAULT_SETUP.md`:
- Initial Vault setup (dev mode)
- Production Vault setup with Kubernetes auth
- Policy and role creation commands
- ESO configuration steps
- Operations procedures (rotation, audit)
- Troubleshooting guide

Updated `ROADMAP.md`:
- Marked Task 42 as ✅ COMPLETE
- Updated Secrets Management status to ✅ Implemented
- Updated Top 10 Gaps (Vault marked as FIXED)
- Updated Production Survivability criteria

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check all layers have Vault health check code
grep -r "check_vault_health" value-fabric/*/src/api/main.py

# Run Vault smoke test
export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.value-fabric.svc:8200
export VAULT_TOKEN=<token>
python scripts/smoke/vault_smoke.py

# Run ClusterSecretStore check
python scripts/smoke/clustersecretstore_check.py

# Verify Vault policies exist
ls k8s/vault/policies/*.hcl

# Check documentation
cat docs/operations/VAULT_SETUP.md | head -20
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| ✅ All `vault.example.com` placeholders replaced | Verified - none found |
| ✅ ClusterSecretStore health check in smoke gate | `clustersecretstore_check.py` created |
| ✅ PostgreSQL dynamic credentials | Already configured in `vault-database-dynamic.yml` |
| ✅ Cross-layer Vault health checks | Added to L1, L2, L3, L5 (L4 already had) |
| ✅ Smoke gate fails if Vault unreachable | All layers hard-fail in production |
| ✅ Policies defined as code | 3 HCL files created |
| ✅ K8s auth roles documented | YAML with ConfigMap + SAs |
| ✅ Documentation updated | secrets-management.md + VAULT_SETUP.md |

## Architecture

**Data Flow:**
```
ExternalSecrets → ClusterSecretStore → Vault (Kubernetes auth) → KV v2 / Database secrets engine
     ↓
Kubernetes Secrets → Mounted as env vars → Application containers
```

**Dynamic Credentials:**
```
Application startup → Read K8s Secret (from ExternalSecret) → Connect to PostgreSQL
                          ↓ (refreshes every 1h)
                   ExternalSecret → Vault Database Engine → New credentials generated
```

**Health Check:**
```
Production mode → Check VAULT_ADDR → HTTP GET /v1/sys/health → Fail startup if not 200/429/473
```
